<p begin="00:34:12.450" end="00:34:14.884">The test itself is a cheat, isn't it?</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.986" end="00:34:16.886">I mean, you programmed it<br />to be unwinnable.</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.988" end="00:34:19.548">Your argument precludes the possibility<br />of a no-win scenario.</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.657" end="00:34:23.218">- I don't believe in no-win scenarios.<br />- Then not only did you violate the rules,</p>

<p begin="00:34:45.283" end="00:34:48.775">- Enlighten me again.<br />- The purpose is to experience fear,</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.687" end="00:34:51.655">fear in the face of certain death.</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.756" end="00:34:55.886">To accept that fear, and maintain<br />control of oneself and one's crew.</p>

<p begin="00:45:28.659" end="00:45:31.526">That same anomaly, a lightning storm<br />in space that we saw today,</p>

<p begin="00:46:13.037" end="00:46:15.028">And Lieutenant Uhura is unmatched<br />in xenolinguistics.</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.139" end="00:46:17.004">We would be wise<br />to accept her conclusion.</p>

<p begin="01:10:32.101" end="01:10:34.831">The contrary, Nero's very presence<br />has altered the flow of history,</p>

<p begin="01:17:23.883" end="01:17:26.317">Using red matter,<br />I would create a black hole</p>

<p begin="01:17:30.189" end="01:17:32.987">I was en route,<br />when the unthinkable happened.</p>

<p begin="01:17:43.369" end="01:17:44.996">I had little time.</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.706" end="01:17:51.574">I had to extract the red matter<br />and shoot it into the supernova.</p>

<p begin="01:18:37.223" end="01:18:41.819">Nero and his crew spent<br />the next 25 years awaiting my arrival.</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.927" end="01:18:43.986">But what was years for Nero</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.531" end="01:18:47.465">was only seconds for me.</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.534" end="01:18:50.661">I went through the black hole.</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.872" end="01:18:55.204">Nero was waiting for me.</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.046" end="01:19:04.174">He held me responsible<br />for the loss of his world.</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.051" end="01:19:08.747">He captured my vessel<br />and spared my life,</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.055" end="01:19:11.545">for one reason.</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.625" end="01:19:14.923">So that I would know his pain.</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.962" end="01:19:20.830">He beamed me here<br />so that I could observe his vengeance.</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.501" end="01:19:25.163">As he was helpless to save his planet,</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.804" end="01:19:28.568">I would be helpless to save mine.</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.744" end="01:19:35.703">Billions of lives lost because of me, Jim.</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.549" end="01:19:38.676">Because I failed.</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.253" end="01:19:45.212">Forgive me. Emotional transference<br />is an effect of the mind-meld.</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.831" end="01:19:55.425">- So you do feel.<br />- Yes.</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.268" end="01:19:59.294">Going back in time,<br />you changed all our lives.</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.672" end="01:20:02.505">Jim, we must go.</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.275" end="01:20:06.267">There is a Starfleet outpost<br />not far from here.</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.213" end="01:20:11.081">Wait. Where you came from,</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.752" end="01:20:15.481">did I know my father?</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.689" end="01:20:17.713">Yes.</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.557" end="01:20:22.687">You often spoke of him as being<br />your inspiration for joining Starfleet.</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.828" end="01:20:26.525">He proudly lived to see you<br />become Captain of the Enterprise.</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.199" end="01:20:28.461">Captain?</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.567" end="01:20:31.695">A ship we must return you to<br />as soon as possible.</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.979" end="01:20:42.345">- Warp 3, sir.<br />- Course 1-5-1, mark 3.</p>

<p begin="01:20:52.391" end="01:20:55.258">I recognize that supporting me<br />as you did must have been difficult.</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.427" end="01:20:56.985">Is that a thank-you?</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.096" end="01:20:59.758">I am simply acknowledging<br />your difficulties.</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.865" end="01:21:01.628">Permission to speak freely, sir.</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.135" end="01:21:06.571">- I welcome it.<br />- Do you? Okay, then.</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.905" end="01:21:09.305">Are you out of your Vulcan mind?</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.408" end="01:21:11.876">Are you making a logical choice,<br />sending Kirk away?</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.977" end="01:21:13.740">Probably. But the right one?</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.846" end="01:21:15.279">You know, back home we got a saying,</p>

<p begin="01:21:16.882" end="01:21:19.180">"you don't leave your prize stallion<br />in the stable."</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.285" end="01:21:20.547">A curious metaphor, Doctor,</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.653" end="01:21:24.987">as a stallion must first be broken<br />before it can reach its potential.</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.090" end="01:21:27.388">My God, man, you could at least act<br />like it was a hard decision!</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.493" end="01:21:28.755">I intend to assist in the effort</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.861" end="01:21:31.421">to reestablish communication<br />with Starfleet.</p>

<p begin="01:23:17.035" end="01:23:18.468">Okay, I'm sure you're just<br />doing your job,</p>

<p begin="01:23:20.472" end="01:23:21.700">Six months I've been here,</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.807" end="01:23:24.901">living off Starfleet protein nibs<br />and the promise of a good meal!</p>

<p begin="01:23:27.813" end="01:23:29.678">Punishment, isn't it? Ongoing.</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.782" end="01:23:31.647">For something<br />that was clearly an accident.</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.750" end="01:23:34.548">- You are Montgomery Scott.<br />- You know him?</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.653" end="01:23:36.712">Aye, that's me. You're in the right place.</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.822" end="01:23:39.950">Unless there's another hardworking,<br />equally starved Starfleet officer around.</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.058" end="01:23:42.686">- Me.<br />- Get aff! Shut up!</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.795" end="01:23:45.161">You don't eat anything!<br />You can eat, like, a bean,</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.264" end="01:23:48.722">and you're done.<br />I'm talking about food. Real food.</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.834" end="01:23:51.234">But you're here now, so thank you.<br />Where is it?</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.336" end="01:23:53.236">You are, in fact, the Mr. Scott</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.338" end="01:23:55.533">who postulated<br />the theory of transwarp beaming.</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.641" end="01:23:58.906">That's what I'm talking about.<br />How do you think I wound up here?</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.011" end="01:24:00.478">I had a little debate with my instructor</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.579" end="01:24:04.675">on the issue of relativistic physics<br />and how it pertains to subspace travel.</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.783" end="01:24:08.685">He seemed to think that the range of<br />transporting something like a grapefruit</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.787" end="01:24:10.277">was limited to about 100 miles.</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.389" end="01:24:13.085">I told him that I could not only<br />beam a grapefruit from one planet</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.192" end="01:24:15.160">to the adjacent planet<br />in the same system,</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.260" end="01:24:16.921">which is easy, by the way,</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.029" end="01:24:18.428">I could do it with a life-form.</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.530" end="01:24:21.693">So, I tested it on Admiral Archer's<br />prize beagle.</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.800" end="01:24:25.429">- I know that dog. What happened to it?<br />- I'll tell you when it reappears.</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.537" end="01:24:27.402">I don't know. I do feel guilty about that.</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.506" end="01:24:30.373">What if I told you<br />that your transwarp theory was correct,</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.476" end="01:24:33.707">that it is indeed possible to beam onto<br />a ship that is traveling at warp speed?</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.812" end="01:24:36.303">I think if that equation had been<br />discovered, I'd have heard about it.</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.415" end="01:24:38.280">The reason you haven't heard of it,<br />Mr. Scott,</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.383" end="01:24:41.181">is because you haven't discovered it yet.</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.191" end="01:24:49.524">- Are you from the future?<br />- Yeah, he is. I'm not.</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.329" end="01:24:52.923">Well, that's brilliant.<br />Do they still have sandwiches there?</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.098" end="01:24:54.725">Well, she's a wee bit dodgy.</p>

<p begin="01:25:53.625" end="01:25:57.254">- No, Jim. That is not my destiny.<br />- Your...</p>

<p begin="01:29:58.870" end="01:30:01.430">- That doesn't make you angry.<br />- Are you a member of Starfleet?</p>

<p begin="01:32:53.111" end="01:32:55.636">- What?<br />- Pike made him first officer.</p>

<p begin="01:33:13.131" end="01:33:15.497">Attention, crew of the Enterprise.<br />This is James Kirk.</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.168" end="01:33:21.298">Mr. Spock has resigned commission<br />and advanced me to acting captain.</p>

<p begin="01:33:45.397" end="01:33:47.262">Speak your mind, Spock.</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.201" end="01:33:51.862">That would be unwise.</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.570" end="01:33:55.971">What is necessary is never unwise.</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.308" end="01:34:00.505">I am as conflicted<br />as I once was as a child.</p>

<p begin="01:34:14.292" end="01:34:17.523">I feel anger<br />for the one who took Mother's life.</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.930" end="01:34:21.091">An anger I cannot control.</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.370" end="01:34:30.330">I believe that she would say,</p>

<p begin="01:34:54.132" end="01:34:56.862">Whatever the case, we need<br />to get aboard Nero's ship undetected.</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.968" end="01:34:59.368">We can't just go in there guns blazing,<br />Jim, not with their technology.</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.471" end="01:35:01.598">I'm telling you, the math doesn't support<br />what you're suggesting.</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.706" end="01:35:03.833">- Captain Kirk. Captain Kirk!<br />- Yes, Mr. Chekov. What is it?</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.942" end="01:35:06.035">Based on the Narada's course<br />from Vulcan,</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.144" end="01:35:09.375">I have projected that Nero<br />will travel past Saturn.</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.481" end="01:35:12.746">Like you said, we need to stay invisible<br />to Nero or he'll destroy us.</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.851" end="01:35:15.183">If Mr. Scott can get us to warp factor 4,</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.286" end="01:35:19.916">and if we drop out of warp behind<br />one of Saturn's moons, say, Titan,</p>

<p begin="01:35:22.727" end="01:35:24.922">will make us invisible to Nero's sensors.</p>

<p begin="01:35:27.499" end="01:35:30.662">- we can beam aboard the enemy ship.<br />- Aye, that might work.</p>

<p begin="01:35:33.071" end="01:35:35.767">- Seventeen, sir.<br />- Oh, good, he's 17.</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.874" end="01:35:37.501">Doctor.</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.609" end="01:35:41.010">Mr. Chekov is correct.<br />I can confirm his telemetry.</p>

<p begin="01:35:43.448" end="01:35:46.178">I can beam aboard Nero's ship,<br />steal back the black hole device</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.284" end="01:35:49.048">and, if possible,<br />bring back Captain Pike.</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.154" end="01:35:51.816">I won't allow you to do that, Mr. Spock.</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.923" end="01:35:54.949">Romulans and Vulcans<br />share a common ancestry.</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.059" end="01:35:57.084">Our cultural similarities<br />will make it easier for me</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.195" end="01:36:00.323">to access the ship's computer<br />to locate the device.</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.699" end="01:36:03.667">Also, my mother was human,</p>

<p begin="01:49:48.158" end="01:49:50.991">This is Captain James T. Kirk<br />of the U.S.S. Enterprise.</p>

<p begin="01:50:10.881" end="01:50:15.341">I would rather suffer the end of Romulus<br />a thousand times.</p>

<p begin="01:53:58.175" end="01:53:59.301">Then why did you send Kirk aboard</p>
<p begin="01:53:59.409" end="01:54:01.309">when you alone<br />could have explained the truth?</p>
<p begin="01:54:01.411" end="01:54:04.847">Because you needed each other.<br />I could not deprive you</p>

<p begin="01:54:07.684" end="01:54:12.849">of a friendship that will define you both<br />in ways you cannot yet realize.</p>
<p begin="01:54:14.791" end="01:54:16.884">How did you persuade him<br />to keep your secret?</p>
<p begin="01:54:16.994" end="01:54:20.361">He inferred that universe-ending<br />paradoxes would ensue</p>
<p begin="01:54:20.464" end="01:54:22.864">- should he break his promise.<br />- You lied.</p>
<p begin="01:54:24.334" end="01:54:26.427">I... I implied.</p>
<p begin="01:54:27.004" end="01:54:28.995">- A gamble.<br />- An act of faith.</p>
<p begin="01:54:30.107" end="01:54:33.270">One I hope that you'll repeat<br />in the future in Starfleet.</p>
<p begin="01:54:33.377" end="01:54:35.004">In the face of extinction, it is only logical</p>
<p begin="01:54:35.112" end="01:54:37.808">I resign my Starfleet commission<br />and help rebuild our race.</p>
<p begin="01:54:37.914" end="01:54:40.178">And yet,<br />you can be in two places at once.</p>
<p begin="01:54:41.518" end="01:54:44.214">I urge you to remain in Starfleet.</p>
<p begin="01:54:44.688" end="01:54:48.988">I have already located a suitable planet<br />on which to establish a Vulcan colony.</p>
<p begin="01:54:49.092" end="01:54:52.789">Spock, in this case, do yourself a favor.</p>
<p begin="01:54:54.331" end="01:54:57.562">Put aside logic. Do what feels right.</p>
<p begin="01:55:03.473" end="01:55:07.136">Since my customary farewell<br />would appear oddly self-serving,</p>
<p begin="01:55:07.244" end="01:55:08.472">I shall simply say</p>
<p begin="01:55:09.579" end="01:55:10.978">good luck.</p>

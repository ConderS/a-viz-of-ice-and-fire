<p begin="00:01:33.927" end="00:01:36.247">Damn it, man! That was our ride!<br />You just stunned our ride!</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.931" end="00:01:39.031">Oh, great.</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.100" end="00:01:41.333">Run!</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.941" end="00:01:49.408">What the hell did you take?</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.410" end="00:01:51.090">I have no idea,<br />but they were bowing to it.</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.912" end="00:01:53.445">Kirk to Shuttle One.</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.447" end="00:01:54.914">Locals are<br />out of the kill zone.</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.916" end="00:01:56.916">You are clear. Repeat.</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.918" end="00:01:59.985">Spock, get in there, neutralize the<br />volcano and let's get out of here.</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.260" end="00:02:09.395">We have to do this now!<br />I told the Captain</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.397" end="00:02:11.831">the shuttle wasn't built<br />for this kind of heat.</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.833" end="00:02:13.999">Captain, did the indigenous<br />life forms see you?</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.001" end="00:02:15.968">No, Mr. Spock, they did not.</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.970" end="00:02:17.136">The Prime Directive<br />clearly states</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.138" end="00:02:18.604">there can be no interference</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.606" end="00:02:20.873">with the internal development<br />of alien civilizations.</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.875" end="00:02:22.274">I know what it says!<br />Which is why I'm running</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.276" end="00:02:24.343">through the jungle<br />wearing a disguise!</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.345" end="00:02:28.047">Now drop off your super ice<br />cube and let's go! Kirk out!</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.315" end="00:02:30.282">You're good.</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.284" end="00:02:32.364">If we're gonna do this,<br />we've got to do it now!</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.485" end="00:02:34.553">This ash is killing our coils.</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.555" end="00:02:36.355">You sure you don't want me<br />to go instead?</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.357" end="00:02:38.190">That would be highly illogical<br />as I am already outfitted...</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.192" end="00:02:39.358">Spock, I was kidding.</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.161" end="00:02:43.462">You got this.<br />Guys! We have to go! Now!</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.139" end="00:02:54.940">They're trying to kill us!</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.042" end="00:02:57.343">They're trying to kill us, Jim!</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.178" end="00:02:59.259">I'll see you in 90 seconds.</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.047" end="00:03:02.927">Raising shield 2. Mark 7.</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.618" end="00:03:06.151">Do it, do it!</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.136" end="00:03:25.096">Prerequisite change, 2-7-3.</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.973" end="00:03:29.575">Reduce descent. I repeat...<br />I can't hold this position.</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.577" end="00:03:31.310">Spock, I've got to<br />pull you back up.</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.312" end="00:03:34.113">Negative. This is our only<br />chance to save this species.</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.115" end="00:03:35.676">If this volcano erupts,<br />the planet dies.</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.318" end="00:03:40.019">Pull him back up. Now!</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.334" end="00:03:56.468">Spock, are you okay?</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.042" end="00:04:06.612">I am, surprisingly, alive.<br />Stand by.</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.614" end="00:04:07.713">We have to get him back.</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.715" end="00:04:09.081">I'll suit up.<br />I'm gonna go down.</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.083" end="00:04:10.249">We have to abandon the shuttle.</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.251" end="00:04:11.451">We can't just leave him, Sulu!</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.452" end="00:04:14.453">We don't have a choice!<br />Uhura, I'm sorry.</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.455" end="00:04:15.955">Spock, we're going back<br />to the Enterprise.</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.957" end="00:04:17.089">We'll get you out of there.</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.091" end="00:04:19.124">Captain,<br />I'm ditching the shuttle.</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.126" end="00:04:20.326">You've got to make it to the<br />Enterprise on your own.</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.328" end="00:04:22.061">Wonderful!</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.063" end="00:04:24.396">Uhura! You ready to swim?<br />I'm ready.</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.333" end="00:04:27.299">Jim!</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.468" end="00:04:32.037">Jim!<br />The beach is that way!</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.039" end="00:04:33.405">I know!<br />We're not going to the beach!</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.407" end="00:04:35.374">Oh, no, no, no!</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.346" end="00:04:41.180">I hate this!</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.182" end="00:04:42.414">I know you do!</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.592" end="00:05:27.559">Do you have any idea<br />how ridiculous it is</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.561" end="00:05:29.094">to hide a starship<br />on the bottom of the ocean?</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.096" end="00:05:30.596">We've been down here<br />since last night!</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.598" end="00:05:31.663">The salt water's<br />gonna ruin the...</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.665" end="00:05:33.665">Scotty! Where's Spock?</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.667" end="00:05:34.707">Still in the volcano, sir.</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.242" end="00:06:18.644">Captain on the bridge!</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.646" end="00:06:21.313">Lieutenant, do we have<br />an open channel to Mr. Spock?</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.315" end="00:06:23.476">The heat's frying his comms,<br />but we still have contact.</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.851" end="00:06:26.752">Spock?</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.754" end="00:06:28.821">I have activated<br />the device, Captain.</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.823" end="00:06:30.289">When the countdown is complete,</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.291" end="00:06:31.824">the reaction should<br />render the volcano inert.</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.826" end="00:06:33.325">Yeah, and that's<br />gonna render him inert!</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.327" end="00:06:36.428">Negative, sir. Not with<br />these magnetic fields.</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.430" end="00:06:37.729">I need to beam Spock<br />back to the ship.</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.731" end="00:06:39.731">Give me one way to do it.</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.733" end="00:06:42.101">Uh, maybe if we had<br />a direct line of sight.</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.103" end="00:06:44.503">You're talking about<br />an active volcano!</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.505" end="00:06:46.438">Sir, if that thing erupts,</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.440" end="00:06:48.407">I cannot guarantee<br />we can withstand the heat!</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.409" end="00:06:50.476">I don't know that we can<br />maintain that kind of altitude.</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.478" end="00:06:51.777">Our shuttle was concealed<br />by the ash cloud,</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.779" end="00:06:53.445">but the Enterprise<br />is too large.</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.447" end="00:06:55.614">If utilized in a rescue effort,</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.616" end="00:06:57.382">it would be revealed<br />to the indigenous specie.</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.384" end="00:06:59.185">Spock, nobody knows<br />the rules better than you,</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.186" end="00:07:01.253">but there has got to be<br />an exception.</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.255" end="00:07:03.589">None. Such action violates<br />the Prime Directive.</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.591" end="00:07:05.858">Shut up, Spock! We're trying<br />to save you, damn it!</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.860" end="00:07:08.460">Doctor, the needs of the many<br />outweigh the needs of the few.</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.462" end="00:07:10.829">Spock, we're talking<br />about your life!</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.831" end="00:07:12.664">The rule cannot be broken...</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.666" end="00:07:14.433">Spock!</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.435" end="00:07:15.516">Try to get him back online.</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.402" end="00:07:18.337">Ninety seconds to detonations.</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.240" end="00:07:22.875">If Spock were here and I were<br />there, what would he do?</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.212" end="00:07:27.613">He'd let you die.</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.550" end="00:09:10.782">Spock!</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.618" end="00:09:12.784">You all right?</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.886" end="00:09:15.247">Captain, you let them<br />see our ship.</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.321" end="00:09:16.822">He's fine.</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.824" end="00:09:17.689">Bridge to Captain Kirk.</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.691" end="00:09:19.258">Yes, Lieutenant.</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.260" end="00:09:21.293">Is Commander Spock<br />on board, sir?</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.295" end="00:09:22.694">Safely and soundly.</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.696" end="00:09:23.962">Please notify him<br />that his device</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.964" end="00:09:25.045">has successfully detonated.</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.766" end="00:09:28.526">You hear that?<br />Congratulations, Spock.</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.636" end="00:09:31.436">You just saved the world.</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.438" end="00:09:33.438">You violated<br />the Prime Directive.</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.440" end="00:09:35.841">Oh, come on, Spock.<br />They saw us. Big deal.</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.900" end="00:12:15.467">I can save her.</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.772" end="00:12:21.606">What did you say?</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.608" end="00:12:22.908">Your daughter.</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.143" end="00:12:25.877">I can save her.</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.079" end="00:12:28.447">Who are you?</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.234" end="00:12:50.168">Oh, Jim. Come on, let it go.</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.170" end="00:12:51.970">Jim!</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.972" end="00:12:54.172">You're not actually gonna<br />answer that, are you?</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.809" end="00:12:59.778">Spock, I'm telling you, this<br />is why he called. I can feel it.</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.780" end="00:13:01.947">Your feeling aside, I<br />consider it highly unlikely</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.949" end="00:13:04.115">that we will be selected<br />for the new program.</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.117" end="00:13:06.585">Why else would Pike<br />want to see us?</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.587" end="00:13:07.986">Forget about seniority.</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.988" end="00:13:09.688">They gave us the newest ship<br />in the fleet.</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.690" end="00:13:11.790">I can think of<br />numerous possibilities.</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.792" end="00:13:14.626">A five-year mission, Spock!</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.628" end="00:13:16.862">That's deep space!<br />That's uncharted territory!</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.864" end="00:13:19.931">Think how incredible that's gonna be.<br />Hey, ladies. Jim Kirk.</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.967" end="00:13:23.735">"Uneventful."<br />Admiral?</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.737" end="00:13:26.037">It's the way you described the survey<br />of Nibiru in your captain's log.</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.039" end="00:13:28.039">Uh, yes, sir, I didn't want to waste<br />your time going over the details.</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.041" end="00:13:30.141">Tell me more<br />about this volcano.</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.143" end="00:13:31.877">Data says<br />it was highly volatile.</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.879" end="00:13:33.178">If it were to erupt,<br />it would wipe out the planet.</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.180" end="00:13:34.713">Let's hope it doesn't, sir.</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.715" end="00:13:35.836">Something tells me it won't.</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.983" end="00:13:38.917">Uh, well, sir,<br />volatile is all relative.</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.919" end="00:13:40.919">Maybe our data was off.</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.921" end="00:13:42.287">Or maybe it didn't erupt</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.289" end="00:13:44.956">because Mr. Spock detonated<br />a cold fusion device</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.958" end="00:13:47.158">inside it right after<br />a civilization</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.160" end="00:13:49.895">that's barely<br />invented the wheel</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.897" end="00:13:52.797">happened to see a starship<br />rising out of their ocean!</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.799" end="00:13:54.933">That is pretty much how<br />you describe it, is it not?</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.935" end="00:13:56.568">Admiral...<br />You filed a report?</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.570" end="00:13:58.570">Why didn't you tell me?</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.572" end="00:14:00.939">I incorrectly assumed that you would<br />be truthful in your captain's log.</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.941" end="00:14:03.141">Yeah, I would have been if I<br />didn't have to save your life,</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.143" end="00:14:05.844">and the very reason<br />I felt it necessary</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.846" end="00:14:07.045">to take responsibility<br />for the actions...</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.047" end="00:14:08.580">Take responsibility, yeah.</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.582" end="00:14:09.881">That'd be so noble, pointy,</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.883" end="00:14:11.316">if you weren't also<br />throwing me under the bus.</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.318" end="00:14:13.119">"Pointy"? Is that<br />a derogatory reference to...</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.120" end="00:14:15.554">Gentlemen.</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.556" end="00:14:19.257">Starfleet's mandate is to explore<br />and observe, not to interfere.</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.259" end="00:14:21.059">Had the mission gone<br />according to plan, Admiral,</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.061" end="00:14:22.193">the indigenous species<br />would never</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.195" end="00:14:23.261">have been aware<br />of our interference.</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.263" end="00:14:24.963">That's a technicality.</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.965" end="00:14:26.798">I am Vulcan, sir.<br />We embrace technicality.</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.800" end="00:14:28.967">Are you giving me<br />attitude, Spock?</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.969" end="00:14:30.235">I'm expressing multiple<br />attitudes simultaneously, sir.</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.237" end="00:14:31.570">To which are you referring?</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.572" end="00:14:32.337">Out.</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.773" end="00:14:35.073">You're dismissed, Commander.</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.916" end="00:14:46.785">You have any idea what<br />a pain in the ass you are?</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.820" end="00:14:49.220">I think so, sir.</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.222" end="00:14:50.622">So tell me what you did wrong.</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.624" end="00:14:52.064">What's the lesson<br />to be learned here?</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.758" end="00:14:54.326">Never trust a Vulcan.</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.328" end="00:14:56.761">Now, see, you can't even<br />answer the question. You lied.</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.763" end="00:14:58.863">On an official report,<br />you lied.</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.865" end="00:15:00.098">You think the rules<br />don't apply to you</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.100" end="00:15:02.000">'cause you disagree with them.</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.002" end="00:15:03.335">That's why you talked me into<br />signing up in the first place.</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.337" end="00:15:05.070">It's why you gave me your ship.</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.072" end="00:15:07.639">I gave you my ship because<br />I saw a greatness in you.</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.008" end="00:15:11.710">And now, I see you haven't<br />got an ounce of humility.</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.712" end="00:15:12.811">What was I supposed to do,<br />let Spock die?</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.813" end="00:15:14.613">You're missing the point.</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.615" end="00:15:15.947">I don't think I am, sir.<br />What would you have done?</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.949" end="00:15:17.649">I wouldn't have risked<br />my First Officer's life</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.651" end="00:15:19.150">in the first place!</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.152" end="00:15:20.919">You were supposed<br />to survey a planet,</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.921" end="00:15:23.188">not alter its destiny!</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.190" end="00:15:25.256">You violated a dozen<br />Starfleet regulations</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.258" end="00:15:27.225">and almost got everyone<br />under your command killed.</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.227" end="00:15:29.127">Except I didn't!</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.129" end="00:15:30.862">You know how many crew<br />members I've lost? Not one!</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.864" end="00:15:32.631">That's your problem,<br />you think you're infallible!</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.633" end="00:15:33.765">You think you can't<br />make a mistake.</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.767" end="00:15:35.166">It's a pattern with you!</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.168" end="00:15:37.369">The rules are for other people!<br />Some should be.</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.371" end="00:15:39.070">And what's worse<br />is you using blind luck</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.072" end="00:15:40.905">to justify your playing God!</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.310" end="00:15:46.211">Given the circumstances,</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.213" end="00:15:48.146">this has been brought to<br />Admiral Marcus's attention.</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.148" end="00:15:50.882">He convened a special tribunal,<br />to which I was not invited.</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.884" end="00:15:53.284">You understand what Starfleet<br />regulations mandate</p>

<p begin="00:15:58.858" end="00:16:00.578">They've taken the Enterprise<br />away from you.</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.961" end="00:16:03.662">They're sending you<br />back to the Academy.</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.901" end="00:16:10.402">Admiral, listen...</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.404" end="00:16:15.373">I understand regulation, but<br />every decision I've made...</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.375" end="00:16:16.841">No! I can't listen!</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.843" end="00:16:18.743">You don't comply<br />with the rules,</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.745" end="00:16:20.779">you don't take responsibility<br />for anything,</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.781" end="00:16:22.280">and you don't<br />respect the chair.</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.450" end="00:16:25.950">You know why?</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.386" end="00:16:28.953">Because you're<br />not ready for it.</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.148" end="00:18:39.150">Blue security clearance now<br />permitted for airlock access.</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.152" end="00:18:41.486">I'm going to need<br />three titanium...</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.488" end="00:18:44.169">Radiation<br />protection is required in this area.</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.357" end="00:19:52.957">How did you find me?</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.959" end="00:19:54.439">I know you better<br />than you think I do.</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.930" end="00:19:59.930">The first time I found you<br />was in a dive like this.</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.100" end="00:20:03.902">Remember that? You got<br />your ass handed to you.</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.904" end="00:20:05.336">No, I didn't.</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.338" end="00:20:07.238">You don't? No, that's<br />not what happened.</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.240" end="00:20:09.641">That was an epic beating.<br />No, it wasn't.</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.643" end="00:20:11.643">You had napkins<br />hanging out of your nose.</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.645" end="00:20:13.378">Did you not?</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.681" end="00:20:17.415">Yeah, that was a good fight.</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.417" end="00:20:20.051">"A good fight."</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.355" end="00:20:25.256">I think that's your problem<br />right there.</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.229" end="00:20:31.696">They gave her back to me.</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.998" end="00:20:34.132">The Enterprise.</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.945" end="00:20:46.711">Congratulations.</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.282" end="00:20:52.162">Watch your back with<br />that First Officer, though.</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.286" end="00:20:55.453">Spock's not going<br />to be working with me.</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.455" end="00:20:56.721">He's been transferred.</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.057" end="00:20:59.424">U.S.S. Bradbury.</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.294" end="00:21:03.995">You're going to be<br />my First Officer.</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.064" end="00:21:07.065">Yeah, Marcus took<br />some convincing.</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.168" end="00:21:11.469">But every now and then<br />I can make a good case.</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.207" end="00:21:16.441">What did you tell him?</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.576" end="00:21:19.277">The truth.</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.279" end="00:21:20.611">That I believe in you.</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.215" end="00:21:25.750">That if anybody deserves a<br />second chance, it's Jim Kirk.</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.028" end="00:21:37.028">I don't know what to say.</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.497" end="00:21:39.664">That is a first.</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.034" end="00:21:43.401">It's going to be okay, son.</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.244" end="00:21:52.577">"Emergency session,<br />Daystrom."</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.279" end="00:21:55.346">That's us.</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.015" end="00:21:57.081">Yeah.</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.183" end="00:21:59.350">Suit up.</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.663" end="00:22:14.565">All Starfleet<br />personnel, please be advised,</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.567" end="00:22:17.402">- new security protocols are in effect.<br />- Captain.</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.404" end="00:22:19.070">Not anymore, Spock.<br />First Officer.</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.773" end="00:22:23.508">I was demoted<br />and you were reassigned.</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.510" end="00:22:24.809">It is fortunate<br />that the consequences</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.811" end="00:22:26.377">were not more severe.</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.379" end="00:22:27.645">You've got to be kidding me.</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.647" end="00:22:28.546">Captain, it was never<br />my intention...</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.548" end="00:22:30.281">Not Captain.</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.283" end="00:22:31.482">I saved your life, Spock.</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.484" end="00:22:33.384">You wrote a report,<br />I lost my ship.</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.687" end="00:22:38.489">Commander, I see now<br />I should have alerted you</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.491" end="00:22:40.358">to the fact that<br />I submitted the report.</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.360" end="00:22:42.493">No, I'm familiar<br />with your compulsion</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.495" end="00:22:45.563">to follow the rules. But<br />you see, I can't do that.</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.565" end="00:22:47.565">Where I come from,<br />if someone saves your life,</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.567" end="00:22:48.733">you don't stab him in the back.</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.735" end="00:22:51.102">Vulcans cannot lie.</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.104" end="00:22:52.370">Then I'm talking to the<br />half-human part of you.</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.372" end="00:22:54.405">All right?</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.407" end="00:22:57.075">Do you understand<br />why I went back for you?</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.077" end="00:23:00.211">Commander Spock? Frank Abbot, U.S.S.<br />Bradbury.</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.213" end="00:23:01.312">Guess you're with me.</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.315" end="00:23:04.482">Yes, Captain.</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.357" end="00:23:13.691">The truth is</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.794" end="00:23:17.261">I'm going to miss you.</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.737" end="00:23:27.738">Admiral Marcus, sir.</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.308" end="00:23:32.210">Thank you for convening<br />on such short notice.</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.212" end="00:23:33.311">Be seated.</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.181" end="00:23:38.783">By now, some of you have heard<br />what happened in London.</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.785" end="00:23:41.219">The target was<br />a Starfleet data archive.</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.221" end="00:23:42.320">Now it's a damned<br />hole in the ground,</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.322" end="00:23:44.155">42 men and women are dead.</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.157" end="00:23:45.623">One hour ago,</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.625" end="00:23:47.558">I received a message<br />from a Starfleet officer,</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.560" end="00:23:49.861">who confessed to<br />carrying out this attack,</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.863" end="00:23:52.396">that he was being<br />forced to do it by this man,</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.398" end="00:23:55.600">Commander John Harrison.<br />He's one of our own.</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.602" end="00:23:57.763">And he is the man responsible<br />for this act of savagery.</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.538" end="00:24:00.905">For reasons unknown, John<br />Harrison has just declared</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.907" end="00:24:04.308">a one-man war<br />against Starfleet.</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.310" end="00:24:07.445">And under no circumstances<br />are we to allow this man</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.447" end="00:24:10.248">to escape Federation space.</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.250" end="00:24:11.616">You here tonight represent<br />the senior command</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.618" end="00:24:13.651">of all the vessels<br />in the region.</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.653" end="00:24:16.220">And in the name<br />of those we lost,</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.222" end="00:24:17.889">you will run this bastard down.</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.358" end="00:24:23.327">This is a manhunt, pure and<br />simple, so let's get to work.</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.329" end="00:24:25.296">Earth's perimeter sensors<br />have not detected</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.298" end="00:24:26.797">any warp signatures<br />leaving the system,</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.799" end="00:24:27.880">so we know he can't be far.</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.535" end="00:24:31.869">You will park your ships<br />in a blockade formation</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.871" end="00:24:34.172">then deploy search vehicles<br />and landing parties</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.174" end="00:24:37.575">to run down every lead.</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.577" end="00:24:39.210">This man has shown willingness<br />to kill innocent people,</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.212" end="00:24:41.779">so the rules of engagement<br />are simple.</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.781" end="00:24:44.649">If you come across this man<br />and fear for your life</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.651" end="00:24:46.784">or the lives of those nearby,</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.786" end="00:24:49.720">you are authorized to<br />use deadly force on sight.</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.722" end="00:24:51.789">What's in the bag?<br />James, not now.</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.791" end="00:24:53.691">It doesn't seem odd to you<br />that he'd target an archive?</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.693" end="00:24:55.426">It's like bombing a library.</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.428" end="00:24:57.461">Chris?<br />Everything okay there?</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.463" end="00:25:00.231">Yes, sir. Mr. Kirk<br />is just acclimating</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.233" end="00:25:02.200">to his new position<br />as First Officer.</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.202" end="00:25:03.601">You got something to say,<br />Kirk, say it.</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.603" end="00:25:04.936">Tomorrow's too late.</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.472" end="00:25:09.440">I'm fine, sir.<br />My apologies.</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.442" end="00:25:10.975">Spit it out, son.<br />Don't be shy.</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.644" end="00:25:15.446">Why the archive?</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.448" end="00:25:17.848">All that information<br />is public record.</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.850" end="00:25:19.411">If he really wanted<br />to damage Starfleet,</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.920" end="00:25:23.621">this could just<br />be the beginning.</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.623" end="00:25:25.523">The beginning of what,<br />Mr. Kirk?</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.525" end="00:25:28.459">Sir, in the event of an<br />attack, protocol mandates</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.461" end="00:25:31.262">that senior command gather<br />captains and first officers</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.264" end="00:25:32.763">at Starfleet H.Q.,<br />right here</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.800" end="00:25:36.934">- in this room.<br />- It is curious Harrison</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.936" end="00:25:39.177">would commandeer a jump ship<br />without warp capabilities...</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.710" end="00:25:45.610">Clear the room!</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.950" end="00:25:51.916">No!</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.520" end="00:25:56.654">We need an air defense team!<br />Daystrom Conference Room!</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.992" end="00:26:00.358">- Let's go!<br />- Cover me!</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.034" end="00:26:10.534">- Target acquired.<br />- Take him out!</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.536" end="00:26:11.496">Watch my flank!</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.305" end="00:26:15.039">- Go, go, go!<br />- Cover me!</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.351" end="00:27:00.051">Fire!</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.255" end="00:30:23.988">Yeah?</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.990" end="00:30:26.657">Commander,<br />Mr. Scott has found something</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.659" end="00:30:28.692">in the wreckage<br />of Harrison's ship.</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.694" end="00:30:30.594">He has asked<br />to see us right away.</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.998" end="00:30:35.866">Captain! I found this<br />in the crashed jump ship, sir.</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.868" end="00:30:36.901">This is how<br />the bastard got away.</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.903" end="00:30:38.168">What do you mean?</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.170" end="00:30:40.037">It's a portable<br />transwarp beaming device.</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.039" end="00:30:41.605">Well, can you<br />figure out where he went?</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.607" end="00:30:43.974">I already did, sir.<br />And you're no gonna like it.</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.545" end="00:30:46.785">He's gone<br />to the one place we...</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.679" end="00:30:49.179">We just can't go.</p>

<p begin="00:30:55.020" end="00:30:58.589">He's on Kronos, sir.</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.591" end="00:31:00.257">I request my command<br />be reinstated</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.259" end="00:31:01.725">and your permission<br />to go after him.</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.295" end="00:31:04.295">Give us a minute.</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.031" end="00:31:07.665">Kronos.<br />Yes, sir.</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.667" end="00:31:10.167">So Harrison's gone<br />to the Klingon homeworld.</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.169" end="00:31:11.802">Is he defecting?<br />Uh, we're not sure, sir.</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.804" end="00:31:13.203">He has taken refuge<br />in the Ketha Province,</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.205" end="00:31:14.238">a region uninhabited<br />for decades.</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.240" end="00:31:16.140">He's gotta be<br />hiding there, sir!</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.142" end="00:31:17.341">He knows if we even<br />go near Klingon space,</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.343" end="00:31:18.876">it'd be all-out war.</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.878" end="00:31:20.711">Starfleet can't go after him,<br />but I can.</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.746" end="00:31:22.913">Please, sir.</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.750" end="00:31:28.218">All-out war with the Klingons<br />is inevitable, Mr. Kirk.</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.220" end="00:31:29.887">If you ask me,<br />it's already begun.</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.889" end="00:31:31.355">Since we first learned<br />of their existence,</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.357" end="00:31:33.357">the Klingon Empire<br />has conquered and occupied</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.359" end="00:31:34.959">two planets that we know of</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.961" end="00:31:36.927">and fired on our ships<br />half a dozen times.</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.264" end="00:31:40.664">They are coming our way.</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.767" end="00:31:45.603">London was not an archive.</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.605" end="00:31:46.971">It was a top-secret<br />branch of Starfleet</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.973" end="00:31:49.907">designated Section 31.</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.909" end="00:31:51.642">They were developing<br />defense technology</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.644" end="00:31:53.611">and training our officers<br />to gather intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.613" end="00:31:54.878">on the Klingons<br />and any other potential enemy</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.880" end="00:31:57.281">who means to do us harm.</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.283" end="00:31:59.016">Harrison was one<br />of our top agents.</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.018" end="00:32:01.098">Well, now he's a fugitive<br />and I want to take him out.</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.188" end="00:32:05.389">Pike always said you were<br />one of our best and brightest.</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.324" end="00:32:09.827">You should have<br />heard him defend you.</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.829" end="00:32:12.269">He's the one who talked you into<br />joining Starfleet, wasn't he?</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.631" end="00:32:14.732">Yes, sir.</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.734" end="00:32:16.654">Did he ever tell you<br />who talked him into joining?</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.906" end="00:32:22.706">His death is on me.</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.376" end="00:32:25.676">And yours can't be.</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.678" end="00:32:26.877">Sir, please. All I...</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.879" end="00:32:28.679">Mr. Spock,<br />you said the province</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.681" end="00:32:29.947">where Harrison is hiding<br />is uninhabited?</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.949" end="00:32:30.748">Affirmative, sir.</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.786" end="00:32:36.687">As part of our<br />defensive strategy,</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.689" end="00:32:38.422">31 developed<br />a new photon torpedo.</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.359" end="00:32:43.160">Long-range and untraceable,</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.162" end="00:32:45.696">it would be invisible<br />to Klingon sensors.</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.698" end="00:32:48.766">I don't want you hurt,<br />but I want to take him out.</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.768" end="00:32:50.334">You park on the edge<br />of the Neutral Zone,</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.336" end="00:32:52.670">you lock onto<br />Harrison's position,</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.672" end="00:32:55.939">you fire, you kill him<br />and you haul ass.</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.941" end="00:32:58.275">Permission to reinstate<br />Mr. Spock as my First Officer.</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.111" end="00:33:01.045">Granted.</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.853" end="00:33:09.787">Jim!</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.156" end="00:33:13.057">Where were you?<br />For what?</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.059" end="00:33:14.958">Your medical exam.</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.960" end="00:33:17.061">Ten hours ago, you were<br />in a damn firefight.</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.063" end="00:33:19.196">Now it's my duty as ship's...<br />I'm fine, Bones.</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.198" end="00:33:20.297">The hell you are.</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.701" end="00:33:23.934">I'm fine.</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.808" end="00:33:32.242">Status report,<br />Mr. Spock.</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.244" end="00:33:33.343">The Enterprise should be<br />ready for launch</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.345" end="00:33:35.179">by the time we arrive.</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.181" end="00:33:36.980">Good. Good.<br />Captain.</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.950" end="00:33:40.590">Thank you for requesting<br />my reinstatement.</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.120" end="00:33:43.220">You're welcome.</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.823" end="00:33:46.924">As I am again your First<br />Officer, it is now my duty</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.926" end="00:33:48.686">to strongly object<br />to our mission parameters.</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.794" end="00:33:53.363">There is no Starfleet regulation that<br />condemns a man to die without a trial,</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.365" end="00:33:56.133">something you and Admiral<br />Marcus are forgetting.</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.135" end="00:33:58.469">Also, preemptively<br />firing torpedoes</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.471" end="00:34:00.170">at the Klingon homeworld<br />goes against...</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.172" end="00:34:01.872">You yourself said<br />the area's uninhabited.</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.874" end="00:34:03.235">There's only gonna be<br />one casualty.</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.442" end="00:34:06.944">Our orders have nothing to do<br />with Starfleet regulation.</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.946" end="00:34:08.512">Wait a minute. We're firing<br />torpedoes at the Klingons?</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.514" end="00:34:12.049">Regulations aside, this<br />action is morally wrong.</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.051" end="00:34:14.284">Regulations aside, pulling your ass<br />out of a volcano was morally right.</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.286" end="00:34:15.419">And I didn't win<br />any points for that.</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.421" end="00:34:18.756">I'm not gonna take<br />ethics lessons from a robot!</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.758" end="00:34:20.090">Reverting to name-calling<br />suggests that you are defensive</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.092" end="00:34:21.525">and therefore<br />find my opinion valid.</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.527" end="00:34:23.193">I wasn't asking<br />for your opinion.</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.195" end="00:34:25.496">Bones, get that thing<br />off my face.</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.498" end="00:34:27.965">Captain, our mission could<br />start a war with the Klingons</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.967" end="00:34:30.033">and it is, by its very<br />definition, immoral.</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.035" end="00:34:31.869">Perhaps you should<br />take the requisite time</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.871" end="00:34:34.037">to arrive at this<br />conclusion for yourself.</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.039" end="00:34:35.005">Captain Kirk.</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.508" end="00:34:38.308">Science Officer Wallace.</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.310" end="00:34:40.471">I've been assigned to the<br />Enterprise by Admiral Marcus.</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.879" end="00:34:42.045">These are my transfer orders.</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.047" end="00:34:44.882">You requested an additional<br />science officer, Captain?</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.183" end="00:34:46.116">I wish I had.</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.119" end="00:34:50.487">"Lieutenant Carol Wallace."</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.489" end="00:34:52.089">"Doctorate in applied physics"</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.091" end="00:34:54.858">"specializing in<br />advanced weaponry."</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.860" end="00:34:56.020">Impressive credentials.</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.027" end="00:34:57.895">Thank you.</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.897" end="00:34:59.163">But redundant now that I am<br />back aboard the Enterprise.</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.165" end="00:35:00.931">And yet, the more the merrier.</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.933" end="00:35:02.266">Have a seat, Doctor.<br />Thank you.</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.503" end="00:35:07.938">Shuttle crew,<br />stand by for lift-off.</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.861" end="00:35:31.595">No!<br />I'm not signing anything!</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.597" end="00:35:33.864">Now, get these bloody things<br />off my ship! Captain!</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.866" end="00:35:35.199">Is there a problem,<br />Mr. Scott?</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.201" end="00:35:37.267">Aye, sir. I was just<br />explaining to this gentleman</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.269" end="00:35:39.536">that I cannot authorize any<br />weapons on board this ship</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.538" end="00:35:40.971">without knowing<br />what's inside them.</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.973" end="00:35:42.472">Mr. Scott raises<br />yet another point...</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.474" end="00:35:43.373">Report to the bridge.</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.875" end="00:35:45.442">Captain.</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.444" end="00:35:47.277">Mr. Scott,<br />I understand your concerns,</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.279" end="00:35:49.580">but we need these<br />torpedoes on board.</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.582" end="00:35:52.082">Due respect, sir, but photon<br />torpedoes run on fuel.</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.084" end="00:35:53.851">Now, I cannot detect<br />the type of fuel</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.853" end="00:35:55.352">that's in the compartments<br />on these torpedoes</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.354" end="00:35:56.887">because it's shielded.</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.889" end="00:35:59.289">Now, I asked for the<br />specifications, but he said...</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.291" end="00:36:01.225">It's classified.<br />It's classified.</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.227" end="00:36:03.126">So I said,<br />"No specs, no signature!"</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.128" end="00:36:04.962">Captain.</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.964" end="00:36:07.064">Flight check's complete.<br />We're good to go, sir.</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.066" end="00:36:09.132">Thank you, Mr. Sulu.<br />Yes, sir.</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.134" end="00:36:11.415">Now if you'll excuse me, sir,<br />I have a warp core to prime.</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.136" end="00:36:13.604">Get down!</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.606" end="00:36:15.272">Jim, your vitals are way off.</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.274" end="00:36:17.641">Report to the med bay.<br />Scotty!</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.643" end="00:36:19.543">I need you to approve<br />those weapons.</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.545" end="00:36:22.112">I don't have time<br />for a lecture, Scotty.</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.114" end="00:36:25.148">Do you know what this is?<br />It's a warp core.</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.150" end="00:36:28.218">It's a radioactive catastrophe<br />waiting to happen.</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.220" end="00:36:30.320">A subtle shift<br />in magnetic output</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.322" end="00:36:33.023">from, say, firing one or<br />more of six dozen torpedoes</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.025" end="00:36:34.892">with an unknown payload</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.894" end="00:36:36.126">could set off a chain<br />reaction which would kill</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.128" end="00:36:38.328">every living thing<br />on this ship.</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.330" end="00:36:40.530">Letting those torpedoes on board<br />the Enterprise is the last straw!</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.532" end="00:36:42.466">What was the first straw?<br />What was the...</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.468" end="00:36:44.501">There are plenty of straws.</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.503" end="00:36:47.304">How about Starfleet confiscating<br />my transwarp equation?</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.306" end="00:36:49.406">And now some madman's using<br />it to hop across the galaxy!</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.408" end="00:36:50.407">Where do you think<br />he got it from?</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.409" end="00:36:51.975">We have our orders, Scotty!</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.977" end="00:36:54.244">That's what scares me.</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.246" end="00:36:56.647">This is clearly<br />a military operation.</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.649" end="00:36:58.515">Is that what we are now?</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.517" end="00:36:59.878">'Cause I thought<br />we were explorers.</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.351" end="00:37:02.519">Sign for the torpedoes,<br />that's an order.</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.289" end="00:37:05.989">Right, well,<br />you leave me no choice</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.991" end="00:37:07.357">but to resign my duties.</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.359" end="00:37:09.359">Oh, come on, Scotty.</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.361" end="00:37:11.028">You're giving me no choice, sir.<br />I will not stand by...</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.030" end="00:37:12.229">You're not giving me<br />much of a choice...</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.231" end="00:37:13.363">Will you just make an<br />exception and sign...</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.365" end="00:37:14.464">Do you accept<br />my resignation or not?</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.466" end="00:37:16.133">I do!</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.040" end="00:37:23.273">I do.</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.944" end="00:37:27.411">You are relieved,<br />Mr. Scott.</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.355" end="00:37:39.356">Jim,</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.358" end="00:37:43.026">for the love of God,<br />do not use those torpedoes.</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.373" end="00:37:59.076">Attention. Warp<br />core anti-matter containment check</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.078" end="00:38:00.177">in three minutes.</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.549" end="00:38:06.469">Captain! I'm so sorry<br />about Admiral Pike.</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.085" end="00:38:09.319">We all are.</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.321" end="00:38:10.961">Are you okay?<br />Fine, thank you, Lieutenant.</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.464" end="00:38:20.764">Actually, Scotty just quit.</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.601" end="00:38:26.001">And your boyfriend's second-guessing<br />me every chance he gets.</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.407" end="00:38:31.375">I'm sorry,<br />that was inappropriate.</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.377" end="00:38:34.378">It's just sometimes I want to<br />rip the bangs off his head.</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.347" end="00:38:38.027">You know, maybe it's me. I...<br />It's not you.</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.584" end="00:38:40.484">It's not?</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.654" end="00:38:45.689">Wait, are you guys...<br />Are you guys fighting?</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.691" end="00:38:46.790">I'd rather not<br />talk about it, sir.</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.792" end="00:38:48.525">Oh, my God!<br />What is that even like?</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.365" end="00:38:56.066">Your ears burning?</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.068" end="00:38:57.268">Captain on the bridge!</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.635" end="00:38:58.502">Captain.</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.604" end="00:39:02.806">Mr. Chekov. You've been<br />shadowing Mr. Scott.</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.808" end="00:39:05.075">You are familiar with the<br />engineering systems of this ship?</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.077" end="00:39:07.110">Affirmative, sir.<br />Good.</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.112" end="00:39:10.614">You're my new Chief.<br />Go put on a red shirt.</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.352" end="00:39:15.652">Aye, Captain.</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.324" end="00:39:21.524">Retract all moorings,<br />Mr. Sulu.</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.493" end="00:39:24.161">Yes, sir.</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.699" end="00:39:31.234">Docking clamps<br />one, two, and three are released.</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.236" end="00:39:33.037">All moorings retracted.</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.347" end="00:39:44.347">Lieutenant Uhura,<br />open a shipwide channel.</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.349" end="00:39:46.450">Yes, sir.</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.452" end="00:39:48.318">Mr. Chekov,<br />how we looking down there?</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.320" end="00:39:50.487">All systems nominal, Captain.<br />Copy that.</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.489" end="00:39:51.788">Warp available at your command.</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.790" end="00:39:53.290">Thank you, Mr. Chekov.</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.625" end="00:39:55.865">All right. Let's ride.<br />Yes, sir.</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.273" end="00:40:10.953">Channel open, sir.</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.243" end="00:40:14.744">Attention,<br />crew of the Enterprise.</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.746" end="00:40:17.147">As most of you know,<br />Christopher Pike,</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.149" end="00:40:19.349">former captain of this ship<br />and our friend,</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.119" end="00:40:22.452">is dead.</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.355" end="00:40:25.755">The man who killed him<br />has fled our system</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.757" end="00:40:27.691">and is hiding<br />on the Klingon homeworld,</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.693" end="00:40:29.626">somewhere he believes<br />we are unwilling to go.</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.462" end="00:40:34.431">We are on our way there now.</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.433" end="00:40:38.368">That our presence<br />go undetected.</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.370" end="00:40:39.870">Tensions between the Federation</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.872" end="00:40:41.872">and the Klingon Empire<br />have been high.</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.874" end="00:40:43.607">Any provocation could led<br />to an all-out war.</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.722" end="00:40:59.890">I will personally lead<br />a landing party</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.892" end="00:41:01.925">to an abandoned city<br />on the surface of Kronos</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.461" end="00:41:06.496">where we will capture<br />the fugitive, John Harrison,</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.498" end="00:41:07.931">and return him to Earth</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.933" end="00:41:10.267">so he can face judgment<br />for his actions.</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.405" end="00:41:16.525">All right. Let's go get this<br />son of a bitch. Kirk out.</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.580" end="00:41:25.315">Captain, I believe you have<br />made the right decision.</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.317" end="00:41:28.397">If I can be of assistance, I would be<br />happy to accompany you on the away team.</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.387" end="00:41:32.322">You? Happy?</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.324" end="00:41:34.884">I was simply attempting to use<br />your vernacular to convey an idea.</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.427" end="00:41:37.827">Thank you, Mr. Spock.</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.838" end="00:41:50.740">All personnel, prepare<br />for the closing of payload bay doors.</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.683" end="00:42:00.584">Mr. Spock. You startled me.</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.752" end="00:42:03.887">What are you doing, Doctor?</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.889" end="00:42:05.622">Verifying that the torpedo's internal...<br />You misunderstand.</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.624" end="00:42:08.291">What are you doing<br />aboard this ship?</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.293" end="00:42:10.760">There is no record of you being<br />assigned to the Enterprise.</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.762" end="00:42:11.995">Really? That must be<br />some sort of mistake.</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.997" end="00:42:14.231">My conclusion as well,<br />Dr. Marcus.</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.466" end="00:42:18.301">Except that you have lied<br />about your identity.</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.303" end="00:42:20.704">Wallace is the surname<br />of your mother.</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.706" end="00:42:22.539">I can only assume<br />the Admiral is your father.</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.977" end="00:42:28.411">Mr. Spock.</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.413" end="00:42:31.281">I'm aware that I have<br />no right to ask this of you.</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.283" end="00:42:33.683">But please, he cannot<br />know that I'm here...</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.892" end="00:42:43.927">Engineering manually<br />dropped us out of warp, sir.</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.929" end="00:42:45.929">Mr. Chekov,<br />did you break my ship?</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.931" end="00:42:47.397">Sorry, sir.<br />I don't know what happened!</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.399" end="00:42:48.798">The core overheated.</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.800" end="00:42:50.700">I had to activate<br />the emergency stop.</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.702" end="00:42:52.302">It must be a coolant leak.<br />I need time to find it.</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.304" end="00:42:54.904">Sorry, Captain.<br />Damn it.</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.906" end="00:42:57.007">Mr. Sulu,<br />time to our destination.</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.009" end="00:42:58.675">Twenty minutes, sir.</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.677" end="00:43:00.610">That's 20 minutes in enemy<br />space we weren't counting on.</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.612" end="00:43:02.445">All right.<br />We better hop to it.</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.447" end="00:43:04.281">Where's Spock?<br />Here, Captain.</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.283" end="00:43:06.016">You're coming with me<br />to Kronos.</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.018" end="00:43:07.284">Lieutenant, how's your Klingon?</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.286" end="00:43:08.718">It's rusty, but it's good.</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.720" end="00:43:10.820">Good, you're coming, too.</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.822" end="00:43:11.821">This isn't going<br />to be a problem, is it,</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.823" end="00:43:12.889">you two working together?</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.891" end="00:43:14.424">Absolutely not.</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.028" end="00:43:17.927">Unclear.</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.397" end="00:43:20.677">I'll meet you<br />in the shuttle bay.</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.732" end="00:43:24.534">Jim, you're not actually<br />going down there, are you?</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.536" end="00:43:27.737">You don't rob a bank when the<br />getaway car has a flat tire.</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.074" end="00:43:30.473">I'm sure engineering<br />will have us all patched up</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.475" end="00:43:31.741">by the time we get back.</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.743" end="00:43:33.576">Isn't that right,<br />Mr. Chekov?</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.578" end="00:43:35.345">Yes, Captain.</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.347" end="00:43:37.188">I'll do my best, sir.</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.082" end="00:43:39.316">Mr. Sulu, you have the conn.</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.751" end="00:43:42.552">Once we're en route,<br />I want you to transmit</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.554" end="00:43:45.355">a targeted comm burst<br />to Harrison's location.</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.357" end="00:43:47.657">You tell him you have a bunch of real<br />big torpedoes pointed at his head</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.659" end="00:43:49.979">and if he doesn't play nice,<br />you're not afraid to use them.</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.428" end="00:43:52.595">Is that a problem?<br />No, sir.</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.597" end="00:43:54.158">I've just never sat<br />in the chair before.</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.099" end="00:43:56.533">You're gonna do great.</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.402" end="00:44:00.570">Jim! Wait!</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.572" end="00:44:02.939">You just sat that man down<br />at a high-stakes poker game</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.941" end="00:44:05.075">with no cards<br />and told him to bluff.</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.077" end="00:44:07.677">Now Sulu's a good man,<br />but he is no captain.</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.679" end="00:44:11.348">And enough with the metaphors, all right?<br />That's an order.</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.350" end="00:44:13.790">Mr. Sulu, make sure that<br />K'normian ship is ready to fly.</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.095" end="00:44:25.829">Acting Captain Sulu<br />to Shuttle Bay 2.</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.831" end="00:44:27.764">Please have the trade ship<br />we confiscated during</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.766" end="00:44:30.467">the Mudd incident last month<br />fueled and flight ready.</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.469" end="00:44:31.869">Captain Kirk is<br />en route to you now.</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.539" end="00:44:37.507">Ready to deploy, Captain.</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.509" end="00:44:39.442">Lieutenants,<br />lose the red shirts.</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.444" end="00:44:40.777">You are K'normian arms dealers.</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.779" end="00:44:42.045">Put those on.<br />Sir?</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.047" end="00:44:43.480">Look, if this thing goes south,</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.482" end="00:44:45.582">there can be nothing<br />tying us to Starfleet.</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.584" end="00:44:47.650">Unless of course you want to<br />start a war, Mr. Hendorff.</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.652" end="00:44:49.853">No, sir.<br />No, sir.</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.855" end="00:44:50.854">Good. Me, neither.</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.440" end="00:45:12.175">I am detecting a single life<br />sign in the Ketha Province.</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.177" end="00:45:14.177">Given the information<br />provided by Mr. Scott,</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.179" end="00:45:15.912">this is most likely<br />John Harrison.</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.914" end="00:45:17.480">Mr. Sulu,<br />I think we found our man.</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.482" end="00:45:18.681">You let him know<br />you mean business.</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.683" end="00:45:20.016">Aye, Captain.</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.586" end="00:45:24.421">Attention, John Harrison.</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.423" end="00:45:26.823">This is Captain Hikaru Sulu<br />of the U.S.S. Enterprise.</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.025" end="00:45:29.926">A shuttle of<br />highly trained officers</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.928" end="00:45:32.462">is on its way to your location.</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.464" end="00:45:35.131">If you do not surrender<br />to them immediately,</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.133" end="00:45:37.033">I will unleash<br />the entire payload</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.035" end="00:45:39.569">of advanced<br />long-range torpedoes</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.571" end="00:45:42.205">currently locked<br />onto your location.</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.207" end="00:45:45.208">You have two minutes<br />to confirm your complain.</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.210" end="00:45:47.544">Refusal to do so will result<br />in your obliteration.</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.914" end="00:45:52.949">If you test me, you will fail.</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.488" end="00:45:59.622">Mr. Sulu,</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.624" end="00:46:01.558">remind me never<br />to piss you off.</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.997" end="00:46:08.598">We will arrive<br />at Harrison's location</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.600" end="00:46:10.099">in three minutes, Captain.</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.101" end="00:46:12.168">It is unlikely<br />that he will come willingly.</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.170" end="00:46:15.505">I calculate the odds of him<br />attempting to kill us at 91.6%.</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.507" end="00:46:17.040">Fantastic.</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.042" end="00:46:18.522">Good thing you don't<br />care about dying.</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.211" end="00:46:22.145">I am sorry, Lieutenant.<br />I could not hear</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.147" end="00:46:23.748">what you said.<br />Oh, I didn't say anything.</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.050" end="00:46:27.050">Actually, I'd be happy<br />to speak if you're</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.052" end="00:46:30.119">Lieutenant, I would prefer<br />to discuss this in private.</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.121" end="00:46:31.254">You'd prefer not to<br />discuss this at all.</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.256" end="00:46:35.658">What never seems to require<br />your undivided focus...</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.660" end="00:46:36.759">I'm sorry, Captain,<br />just two seconds.</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.761" end="00:46:38.695">Okay... is us.</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.697" end="00:46:41.064">At that volcano, you didn't<br />give a thought to us.</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.066" end="00:46:42.966">What it would do to me<br />if you died, Spock.</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.268" end="00:46:46.002">You didn't feel anything.</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.904" end="00:46:48.972">You didn't care.</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.974" end="00:46:50.807">And I'm not the only one<br />who's upset with you.</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.809" end="00:46:52.141">The Captain is, too.</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.143" end="00:46:53.977">Wha... No, no, no.<br />Don't drag me into this.</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.579" end="00:46:57.280">She is right.</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.282" end="00:47:00.583">Your suggestion that I do not<br />care about dying is incorrect.</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.585" end="00:47:02.552">A sentient being's<br />optimal chance</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.554" end="00:47:04.020">at maximizing their utility<br />is a long and prosperous life.</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.022" end="00:47:05.588">Great.</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.590" end="00:47:06.990">Not exactly a love song, Spock.</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.992" end="00:47:07.891">You misunderstand.</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.827" end="00:47:12.061">It is true I chose<br />not to feel anything</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.063" end="00:47:14.297">upon realizing that<br />my own life was ending.</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.866" end="00:47:17.133">As Admiral Pike was dying,</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.135" end="00:47:19.736">I joined with his consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.738" end="00:47:22.739">and experienced what he felt<br />at the moment of his passing.</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.807" end="00:47:26.075">Anger. Confusion.</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.077" end="00:47:27.310">Loneliness.</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.212" end="00:47:30.580">Fear.</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.582" end="00:47:32.916">I had experienced<br />those feelings before,</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.884" end="00:47:35.618">multiplied exponentially</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.620" end="00:47:37.787">on the day<br />my planet was destroyed.</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.024" end="00:47:41.624">Such a feeling<br />is something I choose</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.626" end="00:47:43.326">never to experience again.</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.630" end="00:47:50.133">Nyota, you mistake<br />my choice not to feel</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.135" end="00:47:52.201">as a reflection<br />of my not caring.</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.004" end="00:47:56.906">Well, I assure you, the truth<br />is precisely the opposite.</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.248" end="00:48:04.213">What the hell was that?</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.616" end="00:48:06.950">What happened?<br />Where's their signal?</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.952" end="00:48:08.685">It cut out.<br />I'm working to get them back.</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.590" end="00:48:15.291">We are being pursued by<br />a D-4 class Klingon vessel.</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.293" end="00:48:16.593">I thought this sector<br />was abandoned!</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.595" end="00:48:18.227">It must be a random patrol.<br />Hold on!</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.933" end="00:48:24.267">This ship has<br />no offensive capabilities.</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.269" end="00:48:26.202">It's got us.<br />Give me all six fuel cells.</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.204" end="00:48:27.804">Aye, Captain.</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.355" end="00:48:46.155">They're closing fast,<br />bearing 285!</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.627" end="00:48:51.507">All right, there! There!<br />We can lose them there.</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.363" end="00:48:54.297">If you are suggesting<br />that we utilize the passage</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.299" end="00:48:55.331">between the<br />approaching structures,</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.333" end="00:48:57.266">this ship will not fit.<br />We'll fit.</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.268" end="00:48:59.769">Captain, we will not fit.<br />We'll fit, we'll fit!</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.223" end="00:49:20.390">I told you we'd fit. I am<br />not sure that qualifies.</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.328" end="00:49:25.962">Any sign of them?</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.964" end="00:49:27.997">- No. Which worries me.<br />- We lost them!</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.999" end="00:49:28.898">Or they're jamming<br />our scanners.</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.900" end="00:49:29.799">Or we lost them.</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.185" end="00:49:50.219">They're ordering us to land.</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.691" end="00:49:54.691">Captain, they're gonna<br />want to know why we're here.</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.925" end="00:49:56.159">And they're gonna torture us.</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.760" end="00:49:58.728">Question us.</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.730" end="00:49:59.896">And they're gonna kill us.</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.399" end="00:50:03.933">So we come out shooting.</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.404" end="00:50:10.907">We're outnumbered, outgunned.</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.909" end="00:50:13.309">There's no way we survive<br />if we attack first.</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.945" end="00:50:17.213">You brought me here<br />because I speak Klingon.</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.148" end="00:50:20.216">Then let me speak Klingon.</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.866" end="00:51:10.466">This isn't going to work.</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.468" end="00:51:12.168">It is our only logical option.</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.170" end="00:51:13.770">And if you interrupt her now,</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.772" end="00:51:15.805">you will not only incur<br />the wrath of the Klingons</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.807" end="00:51:17.540">but that of<br />Lieutenant Uhura as well.</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.169" end="00:51:32.797">I am here<br />to help you.</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.274" end="00:51:51.574">Lieutenant.<br />Thanks, Captain.</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.324" end="00:52:01.659">With respect.</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.701" end="00:52:07.081">There is a criminal hiding<br />in these ruins</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.790" end="00:52:10.459">he has killed many of our people.</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.389" end="00:52:26.934">Why should I care about<br />a human killing humans?</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.686" end="00:52:30.688">Because you care about honor</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.564" end="00:52:34.859">and this man has none.</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.443" end="00:52:38.154">You and your people are in danger.</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.131" end="00:55:02.398">Stand down.<br />How many torpedoes?</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.400" end="00:55:03.699">Stand down!</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.701" end="00:55:06.769">The weapons you threatened<br />me with in your message.</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.771" end="00:55:08.104">How many are there?</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.273" end="00:55:11.173">Seventy-two.</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.281" end="00:55:19.482">I surrender.</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.633" end="00:55:38.401">On behalf of Christopher Pike,</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.136" end="00:55:40.102">my friend,</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.038" end="00:55:42.138">I accept your surrender.</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.297" end="00:56:08.431">Captain!</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.174" end="00:56:18.574">Captain.</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.420" end="00:56:31.587">Cuff him.</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.641" end="00:56:53.709">- Bones, meet me in the brig.<br />- Be right there.</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.544" end="00:56:56.779">Lieutenant.</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.781" end="00:57:00.483">Contact Starfleet, let them know<br />we have Harrison in custody,</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.485" end="00:57:02.384">and we'll be on our way once<br />the warp core is repaired.</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.386" end="00:57:03.519">Yes, sir.</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.670" end="00:57:22.838">- Why the hell did he surrender?<br />- I don't know.</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.840" end="00:57:24.406">But he just took out a squad<br />of Klingons single-handedly.</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.408" end="00:57:25.774">I want to know how.</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.776" end="00:57:27.910">Sounds like we have<br />a superman on board.</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.912" end="00:57:29.211">You tell me.</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.521" end="00:57:39.921">Put your arm through the hole.<br />I'm gonna take a blood sample.</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.271" end="00:57:56.805">Why aren't we moving, Captain?</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.775" end="00:58:01.944">An unexpected malfunction,<br />perhaps in your warp core</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.946" end="00:58:04.847">conveniently stranding you<br />on the edge of Klingon space?</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.849" end="00:58:07.616">How the hell do you know that?<br />Bones.</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.618" end="00:58:10.786">I think you'd find my<br />insight valuable, Captain.</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.490" end="00:58:15.591">We good?<br />Yeah.</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.593" end="00:58:18.360">Let me know what you find.</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.362" end="00:58:21.797">Ignore me and you will get<br />everyone on this ship killed.</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.272" end="00:58:31.774">Captain, I believe he will<br />only attempt to manipulate you.</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.776" end="00:58:33.576">I would not recommend engaging<br />the prisoner further.</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.578" end="00:58:34.843">Give me a minute.</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.691" end="00:58:49.625">Let me explain<br />what's happening here.</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.227" end="00:58:52.561">You are a criminal.</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.563" end="00:58:54.830">I watched you murder<br />innocent men and women.</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.832" end="00:58:57.866">I was authorized to end you!</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.868" end="00:59:01.303">And the only reason<br />why you are still alive</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.305" end="00:59:02.972">is because I am allowing it.</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.974" end="00:59:06.542">So shut your mouth.</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.544" end="00:59:08.844">Oh, Captain, are you going<br />to punch me again</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.846" end="00:59:11.847">over and over<br />till your arm weakens?</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.849" end="00:59:13.782">Clearly you want to,<br />so tell me,</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.285" end="00:59:17.386">why did you allow me to live?</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.921" end="00:59:19.521">We all make mistakes.</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.523" end="00:59:22.258">No. I surrendered<br />to you because,</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.260" end="00:59:24.293">despite your attempt<br />to convince me otherwise,</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.295" end="00:59:26.662">you seem to have<br />a conscience, Mr. Kirk.</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.832" end="00:59:30.699">If you did not, then it<br />would be impossible for me</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.701" end="00:59:32.534">to convince you of the truth.</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.637" end="00:59:38.407">23-17-46-11.</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.643" end="00:59:42.411">Coordinates not far from Earth.</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.413" end="00:59:45.614">If you want to know<br />why I did what I did,</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.616" end="00:59:46.482">go and take a look.</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.651" end="00:59:49.551">Give me one reason<br />why I should listen to you.</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.053" end="00:59:52.855">I can give you 72.</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.857" end="00:59:54.957">And they're on board<br />your ship, Captain.</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.359" end="00:59:58.427">They have been all along.</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.429" end="01:00:01.797">I suggest you open one up.</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.381" end="01:00:19.081">Oh!<br />Hi!</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.957" end="01:00:30.492">You know what really<br />bothers me, though?</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.494" end="01:00:32.494">It's the modifications,<br />you know, the enhancements.</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.697" end="01:00:36.031">Right? And then like that,<br />I'm off the ship!</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.033" end="01:00:37.833">Just for trying<br />to do what's right!</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.768" end="01:00:40.469">And what did you do anyway?</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.471" end="01:00:41.704">You just stood there<br />like an oyster,</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.706" end="01:00:42.705">looking at me!</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.707" end="01:00:44.340">What?</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.342" end="01:00:47.710">Scotty, it's Kirk.<br />Oh, well now!</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.712" end="01:00:50.913">If it isn't Captain James<br />Tiberius Perfect Hair!</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.915" end="01:00:52.581">Did you hear that? I called<br />him Perfect Hair.</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.583" end="01:00:53.816">Where are you?<br />Where are you?</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.818" end="01:00:55.718">Are you drunk?</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.720" end="01:00:58.587">What I do in my private time<br />is my business, Jimbo.</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.589" end="01:00:59.855">I need you to help me out<br />with something.</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.857" end="01:01:00.956">Will you take<br />these coordinates down?</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.958" end="01:01:03.826">23-17-46-11.</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.594" end="01:01:06.362">Hmm.<br />Are you writing?</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.364" end="01:01:08.530">What, you don't think<br />I can remember four numbers?</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.532" end="01:01:11.900">Ye of little faith.<br />What was the third one?</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.635" end="01:01:13.836">Forty-six.</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.071" end="01:01:17.005">I don't know exactly<br />what you're looking for,</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.541" end="01:01:20.581">but I have a feeling you'll<br />know it when you see it.</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.611" end="01:01:23.412">You may have been right<br />about those torpedoes.</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.515" end="01:01:27.783">I will consider that<br />an apology.</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.785" end="01:01:29.065">And I will<br />consider that apology.</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.820" end="01:01:31.820">You are the one who quit.</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.155" end="01:01:34.156">You made me quit!</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.158" end="01:01:35.591">Mr. Scott?</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.526" end="01:01:37.426">Scott. Ah...</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.795" end="01:01:40.462">The nerve of that guy!</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.399" end="01:01:44.800">I am not doing that man<br />any favors!</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.068" end="01:01:46.168">No!</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.437" end="01:01:48.971">Ach! All right, then!</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.973" end="01:01:50.973">Are you out of<br />your corn-fed mind?</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.975" end="01:01:52.908">You're not actually going<br />to listen to this guy?</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.910" end="01:01:55.110">He killed Pike,<br />he almost killed you,</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.112" end="01:01:57.012">and now you think it's a good<br />idea to pop open a torpedo</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.014" end="01:01:58.180">because he dared you to.</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.182" end="01:02:00.549">Why did he<br />save our lives, Bones?</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.551" end="01:02:02.017">The Doctor does<br />have a point, Captain.</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.019" end="01:02:03.452">Don't agree with me, Spock.</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.454" end="01:02:04.654">It makes me very uncomfortable.</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.655" end="01:02:05.921">Perhaps you too should learn</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.923" end="01:02:07.723">to govern your emotions,<br />Doctor.</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.725" end="01:02:08.957">In this situation,<br />logic dictates...</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.959" end="01:02:11.427">Logic? Oh, my God!<br />There's a maniac</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.429" end="01:02:12.795">trying to make us blow up<br />our own damn ship and...</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.797" end="01:02:14.563">That's not it. I don't<br />know why he surrendered,</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.565" end="01:02:16.532">but that's not it.</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.534" end="01:02:18.734">Look, we're gonna open a torpedo.<br />The question is how.</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.736" end="01:02:20.602">But, Jim,<br />without Mr. Scott on board,</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.604" end="01:02:21.970">who exactly is qualified</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.972" end="01:02:24.440">to just pop open a four-ton<br />stick of dynamite?</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.442" end="01:02:25.908">The Admiral's daughter<br />appeared to have interest</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.910" end="01:02:28.010">in the torpedoes and she<br />is a weapons specialist.</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.012" end="01:02:29.711">Perhaps she could be<br />of some use.</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.513" end="01:02:32.114">What Admiral's daughter?</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.116" end="01:02:34.883">Carol Marcus.<br />Your new science officer</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.885" end="01:02:36.486">concealed her identity<br />to board the ship.</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.187" end="01:02:39.655">When were you<br />going to tell me that?</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.657" end="01:02:41.723">When it became relevant.<br />As it just did.</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.725" end="01:02:43.225">Are the torpedoes<br />in the weapons bay?</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.227" end="01:02:45.060">Loaded and ready to fire.<br />What are they?</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.062" end="01:02:46.528">I don't know. That's<br />why I forged my transfer</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.530" end="01:02:47.763">onto your ship to find out why.</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.765" end="01:02:49.765">I do apologize for that.</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.767" end="01:02:52.167">By the way, if I caused you<br />any problems, I am sorry.</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.169" end="01:02:53.602">I'm Carol Marcus.</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.604" end="01:02:54.703">James Kirk.</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.705" end="01:02:55.604">Torpedoes.</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.140" end="01:02:59.575">My father gave me access<br />to every program he oversaw,</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.577" end="01:03:02.044">then I heard he was developing<br />these prototype torpedoes.</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.046" end="01:03:03.712">Uh-huh. When I went to<br />confront him about it,</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.714" end="01:03:05.948">he wouldn't even see me.</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.950" end="01:03:07.716">That's when I discovered the<br />torpedoes had disappeared</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.718" end="01:03:10.185">from all official records.</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.187" end="01:03:12.588">And then he gave them to me.</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.590" end="01:03:15.057">You're much cleverer than your<br />reputation suggests, Captain Kirk.</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.059" end="01:03:17.092">I have a reputation?</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.094" end="01:03:18.974">Yes, you do. I'm a friend<br />of Christine Chapel's.</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.597" end="01:03:21.230">Christine, yes.<br />How is she?</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.232" end="01:03:23.065">She transferred to the<br />outer frontier to be a nurse.</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.067" end="01:03:24.066">She's much happier now.</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.068" end="01:03:25.801">That's good.</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.803" end="01:03:27.644">You have no idea who I'm<br />talking about, do you?</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.905" end="01:03:30.506">What... What are<br />we doing in here?</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.508" end="01:03:32.574">Is this shuttle prepped to fly?<br />Of course it is.</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.576" end="01:03:33.897">Would you please turn around?<br />Why?</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.811" end="01:03:36.044">Just turn around.</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.614" end="01:03:39.781">It's too dangerous<br />to try and open</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.783" end="01:03:41.884">one of these torpedoes<br />on the Enterprise.</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.886" end="01:03:44.253">But there is<br />a nearby planetoid.</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.255" end="01:03:46.021">I can open one up there.</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.023" end="01:03:47.656">But I will need some help.</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.191" end="01:03:49.591">Turn around.</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.793" end="01:03:51.927">Now!</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.796" end="01:03:55.297">Captain on the bridge!</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.299" end="01:03:57.266">Mr. Sulu,</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.268" end="01:03:59.968">have Doctors Marcus and McCoy<br />landed on the planetoid yet?</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.970" end="01:04:02.771">Yes, sir. They're moving<br />the torpedo into position now.</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.773" end="01:04:04.453">Good. Any activity<br />from the Klingons?</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.741" end="01:04:06.308">Not yet.</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.310" end="01:04:08.471">But if we're stuck here much<br />longer, they will find us.</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.145" end="01:04:10.812">Lieutenant Uhura,<br />did you let Starfleet know</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.814" end="01:04:12.314">we have Harrison in custody?</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.316" end="01:04:14.016">Yes, sir.<br />No response yet.</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.318" end="01:04:17.319">Engineering to bridge.</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.321" end="01:04:19.755">Hello. Captain,<br />can you hear me?</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.757" end="01:04:21.990">Mr. Chekov,<br />give me some good news.</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.992" end="01:04:24.927">We found the leak, sir, but<br />the damage is substantial.</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.929" end="01:04:26.194">We're working on it.</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.196" end="01:04:28.797">Any idea what caused it?</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.799" end="01:04:31.833">Uh, no, sir. But I accept<br />full responsibility.</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.970" end="01:04:37.839">Something tells me it wasn't your fault.<br />Stay on it.</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.841" end="01:04:39.321">Shuttle is standing by,<br />Captain.</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.643" end="01:04:42.678">Bones, thanks for helping out.</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.680" end="01:04:44.613">Dr. Marcus asked for the<br />steadiest hands on the ship.</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.615" end="01:04:46.148">You know, when I dreamt<br />about being stuck</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.150" end="01:04:48.050">on a deserted planet<br />with a gorgeous woman,</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.052" end="01:04:49.785">there was no torpedo!</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.787" end="01:04:51.086">Dr. McCoy,<br />may I remind you,</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.088" end="01:04:52.721">you are not there to flirt.</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.723" end="01:04:54.843">So how can these legendary<br />hands help you, Dr. Marcus?</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.991" end="01:04:56.692">Bones!</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.694" end="01:04:58.126">To understand how<br />powerful these weapons are,</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.128" end="01:04:59.695">we need to open the warhead.</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.697" end="01:05:01.129">To do that, we need to<br />access the fuel compartment.</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.131" end="01:05:02.598">Unfortunately for us,</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.600" end="01:05:04.900">the warheads on these<br />weapons are live.</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.902" end="01:05:06.034">Sweetheart, I once performed</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.036" end="01:05:08.136">an emergency C-section<br />on a pregnant Gorn.</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.138" end="01:05:09.738">Octuplets.</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.740" end="01:05:12.040">And let me tell you,<br />those little bastards bite.</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.042" end="01:05:15.077">I think I can work<br />some magic on your missile.</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.079" end="01:05:17.813">Dr. McCoy, there's a<br />bundle of fiber optic cables</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.815" end="01:05:19.081">against the inner casing.</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.083" end="01:05:21.149">You'll need to cut<br />the 23rd wire down.</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.151" end="01:05:22.718">Whatever you do,<br />do not touch anything else.</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.720" end="01:05:24.019">Do you understand?</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.021" end="01:05:25.921">Right. The thought<br />never crossed my mind.</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.923" end="01:05:27.089">Dr. McCoy,</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.091" end="01:05:29.725">wait for my word.</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.727" end="01:05:31.293">I'm rerouting<br />the detonation process.</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.295" end="01:05:33.362">Are you ready?<br />And raring.</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.364" end="01:05:35.631">Good luck.</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.633" end="01:05:37.966">Sir, the torpedo<br />just armed itself.</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.968" end="01:05:39.334">The warhead's gonna<br />detonate in 30 seconds, sir!</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.336" end="01:05:41.970">What the hell happened?<br />I can't get my arm out!</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.972" end="01:05:47.142">The transporter cannot differentiate<br />between Dr. McCoy and the torpedo.</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.144" end="01:05:49.011">We cannot beam back one<br />without the other.</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.013" end="01:05:50.312">Dr. Marcus,<br />can you disarm it?</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.314" end="01:05:53.248">I'm trying. I'm trying.</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.250" end="01:05:54.416">Jim, get her<br />the hell out of here!</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.418" end="01:05:56.051">No! If you beam me back,<br />he dies!</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.053" end="01:05:57.252">Just let me do it!</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.887" end="01:06:01.323">Ten. Nine. Eight.</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.325" end="01:06:03.825">Standing by to transport<br />Dr. Marcus on your command, sir.</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.827" end="01:06:06.261">Four. Three.<br />Shit!</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.834" end="01:06:14.870">Deactivation<br />successful, Captain.</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.073" end="01:06:17.205">Dr. McCoy,<br />are you all right?</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.745" end="01:06:23.879">Bones!</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.947" end="01:06:26.081">Jim?</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.316" end="01:06:29.151">You're going to<br />want to see this.</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.518" end="01:07:38.358">Delta team, deliver<br />your thrusters to loading dock 12.</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.422" end="01:07:41.323">U.S.S. Vengeance,<br />bridge crew</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.325" end="01:07:43.158">requesting entry<br />to construction hangar.</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.162" end="01:07:47.882">You are cleared<br />to enter the hangar.</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.506" end="01:07:59.307">I need a welding team<br />on the number one nacelle.</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.879" end="01:08:04.179">Holy sh...</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.315" end="01:08:07.783">What have we got?</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.785" end="01:08:11.052">This fuel container's been<br />removed from the torpedo</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.054" end="01:08:13.255">and retrofitted<br />to hide this cryo tube.</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.424" end="01:08:16.624">- Is he alive?<br />- He's alive.</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.894" end="01:08:19.861">But if we try to revive him</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.863" end="01:08:21.930">without the proper sequencing,<br />it could kill him.</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.932" end="01:08:23.932">This technology's beyond me.</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.934" end="01:08:25.801">How advanced, Doctor?</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.803" end="01:08:29.171">It's not advanced.<br />That cryo tube is ancient.</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.173" end="01:08:32.541">We haven't needed to freeze anyone<br />since we developed warp capability,</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.543" end="01:08:35.076">which explains the most interesting<br />thing about our friend here.</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.878" end="01:08:37.012">He's 300 years old.</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.289" end="01:08:47.650">Why is there a man<br />in that torpedo?</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.925" end="01:08:50.492">There are men and women</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.494" end="01:08:52.194">in all those torpedoes,<br />Captain.</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.196" end="01:08:53.428">I put them there.</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.133" end="01:08:57.973">Who the hell are you?</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.305" end="01:09:04.606">A remnant of a time long past.</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.309" end="01:09:08.410">Genetically engineered<br />to be superior</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.412" end="01:09:10.946">so as to lead others<br />to peace in a world at war.</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.582" end="01:09:17.085">But we were condemned as<br />criminals, forced into exile.</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.487" end="01:09:20.155">For centuries we slept,</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.858" end="01:09:25.927">hoping when we awoke,<br />things would be different.</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.929" end="01:09:28.163">But as a result<br />of the destruction of Vulcan,</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.165" end="01:09:30.232">your Starfleet began<br />to aggressively search</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.234" end="01:09:31.933">distant quadrants of space.</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.935" end="01:09:34.502">My ship was found adrift.<br />I alone was revived.</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.504" end="01:09:36.371">I looked up<br />"John Harrison."</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.373" end="01:09:37.906">Until a year ago,<br />he didn't exist.</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.908" end="01:09:39.975">John Harrison was a fiction</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.977" end="01:09:41.643">created the moment I was awoken</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.645" end="01:09:45.113">by your Admiral Marcus<br />to help him advance his cause.</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.115" end="01:09:48.083">A smokescreen<br />to conceal my true identity.</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.318" end="01:09:51.419">My name is,</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.421" end="01:09:52.921">Khan.</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.094" end="01:10:01.229">Why would a Starfleet Admiral</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.231" end="01:10:04.900">ask a 300-year-old<br />frozen man for help?</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.902" end="01:10:07.602">Because I am better.</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.604" end="01:10:09.905">At what?<br />Everything.</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.540" end="01:10:13.909">Alexander Marcus<br />needed to respond to</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.911" end="01:10:15.977">an uncivilized threat<br />in a civilized time</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.979" end="01:10:18.113">and for that<br />he needed a warrior's mind.</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.115" end="01:10:19.981">My mind.</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.983" end="01:10:22.183">To design weapons and warships.</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.185" end="01:10:24.286">You are suggesting the Admiral</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.288" end="01:10:26.321">violated every regulation<br />he vowed to uphold</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.323" end="01:10:28.490">simply because he wanted<br />to exploit your intellect.</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.492" end="01:10:31.126">He wanted to exploit<br />my savagery.</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.128" end="01:10:33.929">Intellect alone is useless<br />in a fight, Mr. Spock.</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.931" end="01:10:35.497">You... You can't<br />even break a rule.</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.499" end="01:10:37.699">How would you be<br />expected to break bone?</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.168" end="01:10:42.337">Marcus used me<br />to design weapons.</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.339" end="01:10:45.106">To help him realize his vision<br />of a militarized Starfleet.</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.108" end="01:10:48.176">He sent you<br />to use those weapons.</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.178" end="01:10:51.579">To fire my torpedoes<br />on an unsuspecting planet.</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.682" end="01:10:55.984">And then he purposely<br />crippled your ship</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.986" end="01:10:59.554">in enemy space, leading to<br />one inevitable outcome.</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.556" end="01:11:01.156">The Klingons<br />would come searching</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.158" end="01:11:03.191">for whomever was responsible,</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.193" end="01:11:05.493">and you would have<br />no chance of escape.</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.495" end="01:11:09.664">Marcus would finally<br />have the war he talked about.</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.666" end="01:11:11.333">The war he always wanted.</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.667" end="01:11:13.335">No. No.</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.137" end="01:11:18.573">I watched you open fire in a room<br />full of unarmed Starfleet officers.</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.575" end="01:11:20.508">You killed them in cold blood!</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.510" end="01:11:23.144">Marcus took my crew from me.</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.146" end="01:11:25.447">You are a murderer!</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.449" end="01:11:27.682">He used my friends<br />to control me.</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.355" end="01:11:35.190">I tried to smuggle them<br />to safety</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.192" end="01:11:36.624">by concealing them<br />in the very weapons</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.626" end="01:11:38.293">I had designed,</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.296" end="01:11:42.097">but I was discovered.</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.766" end="01:11:47.102">I had no choice<br />but to escape alone.</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.138" end="01:11:53.241">And when I did, I had<br />every reason to suspect</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.243" end="01:11:57.545">that Marcus had killed<br />every single one</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.547" end="01:12:00.548">of the people I hold most dear.</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.021" end="01:12:07.255">So I responded in kind.</p>

<p begin="01:12:16.433" end="01:12:19.434">Is there anything you would<br />not do for your family?</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.737" end="01:12:23.638">Proximity alert, sir!</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.640" end="01:12:25.306">There's a ship at warp<br />heading right for us.</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.308" end="01:12:27.175">- Klingons?<br />- At warp?</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.177" end="01:12:29.110">No, Kirk.</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.112" end="01:12:31.379">- We both know who it is.<br />- I don't think so.</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.381" end="01:12:32.747">It's not coming at us<br />from Kronos.</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.354" end="01:12:39.554">Lieutenant,<br />move Khan to med bay.</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.556" end="01:12:40.688">Post six security officers<br />on him.</p>

<p begin="01:12:45.829" end="01:12:47.362">Three seconds, sir.</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.366" end="01:12:51.099">Shields.<br />Aye, Captain.</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.591" end="01:13:16.551">They're hailing us, sir.</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.860" end="01:13:19.227">On screen.</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.629" end="01:13:22.430">Broadcast shipwide,<br />for the record.</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.669" end="01:13:27.769">Captain Kirk.</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.706" end="01:13:31.639">Admiral Marcus.<br />I wasn't expecting you.</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.309" end="01:13:35.276">That's a hell of a ship<br />you got there.</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.278" end="01:13:39.347">That you'd taken Harrison into<br />custody in violation of your orders.</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.483" end="01:13:42.550">Well, we, uh...</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.552" end="01:13:44.419">We had to improvise<br />when our warp core</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.421" end="01:13:46.588">unexpectedly malfunctioned.</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.590" end="01:13:48.656">But you already knew that,<br />didn't you, sir?</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.658" end="01:13:50.291">I don't take your meaning.</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.293" end="01:13:51.659">Well, that's why<br />you're here, isn't it?</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.661" end="01:13:53.495">To assist with our repairs?</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.597" end="01:13:56.464">Why else would<br />the head of Starfleet</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.466" end="01:13:58.346">personally come to the edge<br />of the Neutral Zone?</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.768" end="01:14:01.503">Captain,<br />they're scanning our ship.</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.505" end="01:14:03.225">Is there something<br />I can help you find, sir?</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.507" end="01:14:06.207">Where is your prisoner, Ki?</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.209" end="01:14:07.642">Per Starfleet regulation,</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.644" end="01:14:11.346">I'm planning on returning Khan<br />to Earth to stand trial.</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.515" end="01:14:13.915">Well, shit.</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.251" end="01:14:16.518">You talked to him.</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.387" end="01:14:21.256">This is exactly what I was<br />hoping to spare you from.</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.258" end="01:14:23.758">I took a tactical risk<br />and I woke that bastard,</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.760" end="01:14:26.294">believing that<br />his superior intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.296" end="01:14:27.428">could help us protect ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.430" end="01:14:28.630">from whatever came at us next.</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.699" end="01:14:33.201">But I made a mistake.</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.203" end="01:14:35.904">And now the blood of everybody<br />he's killed is on my hands.</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.672" end="01:14:38.406">So I'm asking you,</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.841" end="01:14:40.909">give him to me</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.911" end="01:14:43.311">so that I can end<br />what I started.</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.216" end="01:14:48.750">And what exactly<br />would you like me to do</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.752" end="01:14:50.385">with the rest of his crew, sir?</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.354" end="01:14:55.790">Fire them at the Klingons?<br />End 72 lives?</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.792" end="01:14:57.725">Start a war in the process?</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.727" end="01:15:00.662">He put those people<br />in those torpedoes.</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.664" end="01:15:02.397">And I simply<br />didn't want to burden u</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.399" end="01:15:04.599">with knowing<br />what was inside of the.</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.601" end="01:15:06.568">You saw what this man<br />can do all by himself.</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.570" end="01:15:08.937">If we woke up<br />the rest of his crew?</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.240" end="01:15:13.641">What else did he tell you?<br />That he's a peacekeeper?</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.643" end="01:15:16.945">He's playing you, so,<br />don't you see that?</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.947" end="01:15:20.682">Khan and his crew were condemned<br />to death as war criminals.</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.684" end="01:15:22.817">And now it is our duty<br />to carry out that sentence</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.819" end="01:15:24.686">before anybody else<br />dies because of hi.</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.623" end="01:15:29.624">Now, I'm going to<br />ask you again!</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.693" end="01:15:32.493">One last time, son.</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.697" end="01:15:36.231">Lower your shields.</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.832" end="01:15:38.366">Tell me where he is.</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.604" end="01:15:43.304">He's in engineering, sir.</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.374" end="01:15:46.808">But I'll have him moved</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.810" end="01:15:48.810">to the transporter room<br />right away.</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.812" end="01:15:50.445">I'll take it from here.</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.814" end="01:15:53.715">- Do not drop those shields, Mr. Sulu.<br />- Aye, Captain.</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.717" end="01:15:54.882">Captain, given your awareness</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.884" end="01:15:56.451">of Khan's true location<br />in the med bay,</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.453" end="01:15:58.553">may I know<br />the details of your plan?</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.555" end="01:16:00.955">I told Marcus we were bringing<br />a fugitive back to Earth.</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.957" end="01:16:02.957">That's what we're going to do.</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.959" end="01:16:04.525">Mr. Chekov, can we warp?</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.527" end="01:16:06.561">Sir, if we go to warp,</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.563" end="01:16:09.697">we run the risk of<br />seriously damaging the core!</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.699" end="01:16:11.899">Can we do it?</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.901" end="01:16:15.670">Technically, yes, but I<br />would not advise it, Captain.</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.672" end="01:16:17.705">Noted.</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.707" end="01:16:19.707">Mr. Sulu,<br />set course for Earth.</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.709" end="01:16:20.608">Yes, sir.</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.877" end="01:16:23.311">Punch it.</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.619" end="01:16:32.787">Well, at least<br />we're moving again.</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.458" end="01:16:38.526">If you think you're safe<br />at warp, you're wrong.</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.865" end="01:16:44.632">Lieutenant Uhura,<br />contact Starfleet.</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.634" end="01:16:45.967">Tell them we were pursued<br />into the Neutral Zone</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.969" end="01:16:47.602">by an unmarked Federation ship.</p>

<p begin="01:17:00.583" end="01:17:01.949">Yes, he can.<br />He's been developing a ship</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.951" end="01:17:03.518">that has advanced<br />warp capabilities...</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.520" end="01:17:05.520">Captain! I'm getting a<br />reading I don't understand.</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.951" end="01:17:38.419">Where are we? We're 237,000<br />kilometers from Earth.</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.421" end="01:17:40.655">Shields are dropping.<br />We're defenseless, sir.</p>

<p begin="01:18:16.393" end="01:18:17.725">I heard what you said.</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.628" end="01:18:21.462">That you made a mistake</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.464" end="01:18:23.424">and now you're doing<br />everything you can to fix it.</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.400" end="01:18:25.600">But, Dad,</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.671" end="01:18:33.074">I don't believe<br />that the man who raised me</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.076" end="01:18:36.077">is capable of destroying a ship</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.079" end="01:18:37.979">full of innocent people.</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.981" end="01:18:41.048">And, if I'm wrong about that,</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.050" end="01:18:42.970">then you're gonna have to<br />do it with me on board.</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.121" end="01:18:47.622">Actually, Carol, I won't.</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.825" end="01:18:50.758">Oh.</p>

<p begin="01:19:03.807" end="01:19:05.573">you went rogue<br />in enemy territory,</p>

<p begin="01:19:44.913" end="01:19:47.682">That's a hell of an apology.</p>

<p begin="01:19:49.786" end="01:19:51.226">I was never<br />going to spare your crew.</p>

<p begin="01:20:44.173" end="01:20:45.806">And seeing as I've just<br />committed an act of treason</p>

<p begin="01:21:24.681" end="01:21:26.647">To what? I haven't<br />said anything yet.</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.649" end="01:21:28.182">Since we cannot take<br />the ship from the outside,</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.184" end="01:21:29.917">the only way we can take it<br />is from within.</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.919" end="01:21:31.319">And as a large boarding party<br />would be detected,</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.321" end="01:21:32.687">it is optimal for you to take</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.689" end="01:21:34.655">as few members<br />of the crew as possible.</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.657" end="01:21:36.958">You will meet resistance,<br />requiring personnel</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.960" end="01:21:38.092">with advanced combat abilities</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.094" end="01:21:40.328">and innate knowledge<br />of that ship.</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.330" end="01:21:42.330">This indicates that<br />you plan to align with Khan,</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.332" end="01:21:44.732">the very man<br />we were sent here to destroy.</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.734" end="01:21:46.133">I'm not aligning<br />with him, I'm using him.</p>

<p begin="01:21:48.338" end="01:21:50.371">An Arabic proverb attributed<br />to a prince who was</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.373" end="01:21:52.039">betrayed and decapitated<br />by his own subjects.</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.041" end="01:21:54.842">Still, it's a hell of a quote.</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.844" end="01:21:56.777">I will go with you, Captain.<br />No, I need you on the bridge.</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.779" end="01:21:58.879">I cannot allow you to do this.</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.881" end="01:22:00.715">It is my function aboard<br />this ship to advise you</p>

<p begin="01:22:01.884" end="01:22:03.250">something I firmly believe</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.252" end="01:22:04.619">you are incapable<br />of doing in this moment.</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.621" end="01:22:05.786">You're right!</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.723" end="01:22:09.323">What I'm about to do,<br />it doesn't make any sense,</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.325" end="01:22:11.359">it's not logical.<br />It is a gut feeling.</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.263" end="01:22:17.365">I have no idea<br />what I'm supposed to do.</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.900" end="01:22:22.336">I only know what I can do.</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.338" end="01:22:25.579">The Enterprise and her crew need someone<br />in that chair that knows what he's doing.</p>

<p begin="01:22:33.982" end="01:22:35.116">It's you, Spock.</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.273" end="01:22:59.993">Tell me everything you know<br />about that ship.</p>

<p begin="01:23:10.952" end="01:23:13.387">I will do everything I can</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.389" end="01:23:15.923">to make you answer<br />for what you did.</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.698" end="01:23:24.065">But right now I need your help.</p>

<p begin="01:23:27.703" end="01:23:29.403">You said you'd do anything<br />for your crew.</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.373" end="01:23:33.741">I can guarantee their safety.<br />Captain.</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.277" end="01:23:38.279">You can't even guarantee<br />the safety of your own crew.</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.920" end="01:23:46.640">Bones, what are you doing<br />with that tribble?</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.055" end="01:23:49.090">The tribble's dead.</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.092" end="01:23:51.392">I'm injecting Khan's platelets<br />into the deceased tissue</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.394" end="01:23:53.427">of a necrotic host.</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.429" end="01:23:55.496">Khan's cells regenerate<br />like nothing I've ever seen,</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.498" end="01:23:56.931">and I want to know why.</p>

<p begin="01:24:12.415" end="01:24:14.415">To this ship? How?</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.417" end="01:24:17.084">There's a cargo door,<br />hangar 7, access port 101A.</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.086" end="01:24:18.919">You need to find the manual<br />override to open that airlock.</p>

<p begin="01:24:22.125" end="01:24:23.924">Just listen to him, Scotty.<br />It's gonna be all right.</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.926" end="01:24:25.426">It is not gonna be all right.</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.428" end="01:24:27.428">You want me to open<br />an airlock into space,</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.430" end="01:24:30.931">whereupon I will freeze,<br />die and explode!</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.933" end="01:24:32.032">Lieutenant, from our current<br />position, is it possible</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.034" end="01:24:33.501">to establish contact<br />with New Vulcan?</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.469" end="01:24:36.837">I'll do my best.<br />Thank you.</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.107" end="01:24:41.275">Mr. Sulu, what is<br />the status of the other ship?</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.277" end="01:24:42.910">Their systems<br />are still offline.</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.912" end="01:24:44.378">I'm aligning our ship now.</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.281" end="01:25:21.215">Scotty, how we doing<br />over there?</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.217" end="01:25:23.851">Captain, I wish<br />I had better news.</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.853" end="01:25:25.853">They've locked out access<br />to the ship's computer.</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.855" end="01:25:27.021">They'll have full weapons in</p>

<p begin="01:25:29.258" end="01:25:30.825">That means next time<br />I won't be able to stop them</p>

<p begin="01:26:02.058" end="01:26:04.959">This door is very wee.<br />I mean, you know, small.</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.961" end="01:26:07.294">It's four square meters, tops.</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.296" end="01:26:09.230">It's gonna be like<br />jumping out of a moving car,</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.232" end="01:26:11.165">off a bridge,<br />into your shot glass.</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.167" end="01:26:12.566">It's okay.<br />I've done it before.</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.636" end="01:26:16.203">Yeah, it was vertical.</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.205" end="01:26:19.073">We jumped onto a...<br />It was a...</p>

<p begin="01:26:20.910" end="01:26:23.010">Did you find the manual override?<br />The manual override, Scotty.</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.012" end="01:26:24.411">Not yet, not yet.</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.887" end="01:26:33.320">Captain, before you launch,<br />you should be aware there is</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.322" end="01:26:35.356">a considerable debris field<br />between our ships.</p>

<p begin="01:26:38.194" end="01:26:40.274">Just give me two seconds,<br />all right, you mad bastard!</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.570" end="01:26:50.638">Tell me this is gonna work.</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.007" end="01:26:53.440">I have neither the information</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.442" end="01:26:55.476">nor the confidence<br />to do so, Doctor.</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.478" end="01:26:57.044">Okay, Captain, stand by.</p>

<p begin="01:27:03.352" end="01:27:04.551">Okay, okay!<br />I'm set to open the door.</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.553" end="01:27:05.586">You ready?</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.987" end="01:27:07.221">Are you?</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.625" end="01:27:11.865">Spock, pull the trigger.</p>

<p begin="01:27:48.097" end="01:27:49.297">I know, I know!<br />I can see that.</p>

<p begin="01:28:06.282" end="01:28:08.482">- 37.243 degrees.<br />- Got it.</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.484" end="01:28:09.650">I'm working my way back.</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.620" end="01:28:14.660">Scotty, you're gonna be ready<br />with that door, right?</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.623" end="01:28:17.658">What are you doing in here?</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.660" end="01:28:21.128">Wee bit of maintenance on the<br />airlock console. You're big.</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.130" end="01:28:22.596">Mr. Scott, where are you?</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.598" end="01:28:24.331">Captain,<br />he can't seem to hear you.</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.333" end="01:28:26.253">I'm working on getting<br />his signal back. Stand by.</p>

<p begin="01:28:31.007" end="01:28:33.607">My helmet was hit. Uhura, tell<br />me you have Mr. Scott back.</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.609" end="01:28:38.312">His communicator is working. I don't<br />know why he isn't responding.</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.314" end="01:28:40.647">What is that? Are you Starfleet<br />or private security?</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.649" end="01:28:42.616">Show me your other hand. Because<br />you look like private security.</p>

<p begin="01:29:17.519" end="01:29:19.199">Spock, my display's dead.<br />I'm flying blind.</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.623" end="01:29:23.357">Hitting your target destination<br />is mathematically impossible.</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.825" end="01:29:25.392">Spock, if I get back,</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.394" end="01:29:27.327">we really need to talk<br />about your bedside manner.</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.329" end="01:29:28.796">Commander,<br />he's not going to make it.</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.669" end="01:29:37.104">My display<br />is still functioning.</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.106" end="01:29:39.606">I see you, Kirk, you're 200 meters<br />ahead of me at my one o'clock.</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.608" end="01:29:41.409">Come to your left<br />a few degrees and follow me.</p>

<p begin="01:30:13.342" end="01:30:14.675">Sorry about this.<br />About what?</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.677" end="01:30:15.876">Mr. Scott, open the door!<br />Open the door!</p>

<p begin="01:31:05.194" end="01:31:08.595">Commander, I have that<br />transmission as requested.</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.230" end="01:31:10.597">On screen, please.</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.232" end="01:31:12.199">Stand by.</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.439" end="01:31:19.606">Mr. Spock.</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.276" end="01:31:22.476">Mr. Spock.</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.182" end="01:31:28.248">Admiral.</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.452" end="01:31:32.492">I'll deal with you in a...</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.456" end="01:31:37.357">I am ashamed<br />to be your daughter.</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.697" end="01:31:43.797">Sir, we just had a hangar<br />door open on deck 13.</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.400" end="01:31:47.401">Khan.</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.403" end="01:31:49.436">They're going to have<br />full power and we're walking?</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.438" end="01:31:50.737">The turbolifts<br />are easily tracked</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.739" end="01:31:52.339">and Marcus would have us<br />in a cage.</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.341" end="01:31:54.741">This path runs adjacent<br />to the engine room.</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.743" end="01:31:56.376">They know they won't be able<br />to use their weapons here</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.378" end="01:31:57.544">without destabilizing<br />the warp core,</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.546" end="01:31:59.313">which gives us the advantage.</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.315" end="01:32:01.915">Where'd you find this guy?<br />Oh, it's a long story.</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.917" end="01:32:02.877">I will be brief.</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.485" end="01:32:06.920">In your travels, did you ever<br />encounter a man named Khan?</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.826" end="01:32:13.527">As you know,</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.529" end="01:32:15.796">I have made a vow<br />never to give you information</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.798" end="01:32:18.298">that could potentially<br />alter your destiny.</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.801" end="01:32:23.804">Your path is yours to worth,<br />and yours alone.</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.709" end="01:32:29.543">That being said,</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.412" end="01:32:35.349">Khan Noonien Singh is<br />the most dangerous adversary</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.351" end="01:32:37.284">the Enterprise ever faced.</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.286" end="01:32:41.355">He is brilliant, ruthless,</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.357" end="01:32:43.757">and he will not<br />hesitate to kill</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.759" end="01:32:45.492">every single one of you.</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.497" end="01:32:50.831">Did you defeat him?</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.000" end="01:32:55.302">At great cost. Yes.</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.338" end="01:32:58.905">How?</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.907" end="01:33:00.974">I don't mean to tempt fate<br />here, but where is everybody?</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.976" end="01:33:02.509">The ship is designed to<br />be flown by minimal crew,</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.511" end="01:33:03.610">one, if necessary.</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.612" end="01:33:04.578">One? I...</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.402" end="01:33:28.335">You all right?<br />Yeah. Where's Khan?</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.409" end="01:33:36.576">Lieutenant, I need you to<br />assemble all senior medical</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.578" end="01:33:38.179">and engineering staff<br />in the weapons bay.</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.579" end="01:33:39.646">All right.</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.749" end="01:33:44.751">Dr. McCoy, you inadvertently<br />activated a torpedo.</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.753" end="01:33:46.086">Could you replicate<br />the process?</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.088" end="01:33:47.521">Why the hell<br />would I want to do that?</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.523" end="01:33:49.423">Can you or can you not?</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.425" end="01:33:52.092">Damn it, man, I'm a doctor,<br />not a torpedo technician!</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.094" end="01:33:53.527">The fact that you<br />are a doctor is precisely</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.529" end="01:33:55.090">why I need you<br />to listen very carefully.</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.331" end="01:33:57.497">Where is he?</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.970" end="01:34:04.371">Shit!</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.806" end="01:34:05.906">This way.</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.344" end="01:34:11.945">The minute we get<br />to the bridge, drop him.</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.947" end="01:34:15.515">What, stun him? Khan?<br />I thought he was helping us.</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.517" end="01:34:16.838">I'm pretty sure<br />we're helping him.</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.361" end="01:34:27.828">Power coming online, sir!</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.830" end="01:34:29.363">Retarget the Enterprise now.</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.365" end="01:34:30.463">Aye, sir.</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.379" end="01:34:45.412">Make sure he stays down.</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.681" end="01:34:47.714">Excuse me.<br />Yeah.</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.986" end="01:34:54.588">Admiral Marcus,<br />you're under arrest.</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.590" end="01:34:56.391">You're not actually<br />going to do this, are you?</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.759" end="01:35:00.560">Admiral, get out of the chair.</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.562" end="01:35:03.029">You better stop and think about<br />what you're doing, Kirk.</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.031" end="01:35:05.132">You better think about<br />what you did on Kronos.</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.134" end="01:35:07.868">You made an incursion<br />onto an enemy planet!</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.870" end="01:35:10.170">You killed a Klingon patrol.</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.172" end="01:35:13.573">Even if you got away without<br />a trace, war is coming.</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.575" end="01:35:16.943">And who is going<br />to lead us? You?</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.945" end="01:35:18.845">If I'm not in charge,</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.847" end="01:35:21.014">our entire way of life<br />is decimated!</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.016" end="01:35:24.818">So you want me off this ship,</p>
<p begin="01:35:24.820" end="01:35:27.521">you better kill me.</p>
<p begin="01:35:27.523" end="01:35:28.855">I'm not going to kill you, sir.</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.758" end="01:35:34.528">But I could stun your ass and<br />drag you out of that chair.</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.530" end="01:35:36.630">I'd rather not do that<br />in front of your daughter.</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.735" end="01:35:42.502">You all right?<br />Yes, Captain.</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.572" end="01:35:45.505">Jim!</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.187" end="01:36:00.921">Listen! Wait!</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.735" end="01:36:17.504">You should have let me sleep.</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.478" end="01:36:24.811">Where is the Captain,<br />Mr. Sulu?</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.813" end="01:36:26.780">Our sensor array's down, sir.<br />I can't find him.</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.683" end="01:36:30.817">I'm going to make this<br />very simple for you.</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.819" end="01:36:33.553">Captain.<br />Your crew for my crew.</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.555" end="01:36:35.155">You betrayed us.</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.157" end="01:36:36.990">Oh, you are smart,<br />Mr. Spock.</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.992" end="01:36:38.158">Spock don't...</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.995" end="01:36:43.797">Mr. Spock,<br />give me my crew.</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.032" end="01:36:47.033">And what will you do<br />when you get them?</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.035" end="01:36:49.703">Continue the work we were doing<br />before we were banished.</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.705" end="01:36:51.571">Which, as I understand it,<br />involves the mass genocide</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.573" end="01:36:54.508">of any being you find to be<br />less than superior.</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.510" end="01:36:56.843">Shall I destroy you,<br />Mr. Spock?</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.845" end="01:36:58.945">Or will you give what I want?</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.883" end="01:37:04.017">We have no<br />transporter capabilities.</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.019" end="01:37:05.719">Fortunately mine a<br />perfectly function.</p>
<p begin="01:37:05.721" end="01:37:08.622">Drop your shields.</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.624" end="01:37:10.524">If I do so, I have no guarantee</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.526" end="01:37:12.158">that you will not destroy<br />the Enterprise.</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.160" end="01:37:14.694">Well, let's play this out<br />logically then, Mr. Spock.</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.696" end="01:37:16.530">Firstly,<br />I will kill your Captain</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.532" end="01:37:18.265">to demonstrate my resolve.</p>
<p begin="01:37:18.267" end="01:37:21.234">Then if yours holds,<br />I will have no choice</p>
<p begin="01:37:21.236" end="01:37:23.670">but to kill you<br />and your entire crew.</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.672" end="01:37:25.672">If you destroy our ship,</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.674" end="01:37:27.908">you will also destroy<br />your own people.</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.910" end="01:37:30.777">Your crew requires oxygen<br />to survive, mine does not.</p>
<p begin="01:37:30.779" end="01:37:32.546">I will target your<br />life support systems</p>
<p begin="01:37:32.548" end="01:37:34.981">located behind the aft nacelle.</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.983" end="01:37:38.184">And after every single person<br />aboard your ship suffocates,</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.186" end="01:37:42.055">I will walk over your cold<br />corpses to recover my people.</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.759" end="01:37:46.026">Now,</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.961" end="01:37:48.862">shall we begin?</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.967" end="01:37:54.134">Lower shields.</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.272" end="01:38:00.273">A wise choice, Mr. Spock.</p>
<p begin="01:38:08.750" end="01:38:11.785">I see your 72 torpedoes<br />are still in their tubes.</p>
<p begin="01:38:11.787" end="01:38:13.920">If they are not mine,<br />Commander, I will know it.</p>
<p begin="01:38:13.922" end="01:38:15.922">Vulcans do not lie.</p>
<p begin="01:38:17.358" end="01:38:19.326">The torpedoes are yours.</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.037" end="01:38:32.072">Thank you, Mr. Spock.</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.074" end="01:38:33.974">I have fulfilled your terms.</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.709" end="01:38:35.909">Now fulfill mine.</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.078" end="01:38:38.378">Well, Kirk,</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.614" end="01:38:41.715">it seems apt<br />to return you to your crew.</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.717" end="01:38:43.383">After all,</p>
<p begin="01:38:46.954" end="01:38:50.056">no ship should go down<br />without her captain.</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.860" end="01:38:54.100">He's locking phasers<br />on us, sir!</p>
<p begin="01:39:00.668" end="01:39:02.102">Let us out of here now!</p>
<p begin="01:39:10.746" end="01:39:12.879">Shields at 6%!</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.881" end="01:39:14.648">The torpedoes!<br />How much time, Lieutenant?</p>
<p begin="01:39:14.650" end="01:39:15.815">Twelve seconds, sir!</p>
<p begin="01:39:15.817" end="01:39:17.350">Crew of the Enterprise,</p>
<p begin="01:39:17.352" end="01:39:18.985">prepare for imminent<br />proximity detonation.</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.987" end="01:39:20.954">What's he talking about?<br />What detonation?</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.956" end="01:39:22.636">The torpedoes. He armed<br />the damn torpedoes!</p>
<p begin="01:39:33.200" end="01:39:34.868">No!</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.409" end="01:39:43.010">Sir, their weapons<br />have been knocked out.</p>
<p begin="01:39:44.145" end="01:39:45.879">Not bad, Commander.<br />Thank you, Lieutenant.</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.747" end="01:39:48.715">Bones!<br />Bones!</p>
<p begin="01:39:48.717" end="01:39:50.750">Nurse!<br />I got you. I got you.</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.752" end="01:39:52.018">Dr. Marcus.</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.255" end="01:39:56.056">Good to see you, Jim.</p>
<p begin="01:39:56.058" end="01:39:57.090">You helped Spock<br />detonate those torpedoes?</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.092" end="01:39:58.191">Damn right I did.</p>
<p begin="01:39:58.193" end="01:39:59.959">He killed Khan's crew!</p>
<p begin="01:39:59.961" end="01:40:01.461">Spock's cold,<br />but he's not that cold.</p>
<p begin="01:40:01.463" end="01:40:03.997">I've got Khan's crew.</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.999" end="01:40:06.466">Seventy-two human popsicles</p>
<p begin="01:40:06.468" end="01:40:08.702">safe and sound<br />in their cryo tubes.</p>
<p begin="01:40:09.870" end="01:40:11.270">Son of a bitch!</p>
<p begin="01:40:16.911" end="01:40:19.045">Sir, the central<br />power grid is failing!</p>
<p begin="01:40:19.047" end="01:40:21.481">Switch to auxiliary power.<br />Auxiliary power failing, sir.</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.824" end="01:40:31.791">Commander, our ship's<br />caught in Earth's gravity!</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.793" end="01:40:33.359">Can we stop?<br />I can't do anything.</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.903" end="01:40:44.938">Sorry! Oh, no.</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.940" end="01:40:47.173">Clear the area!</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.175" end="01:40:49.876">Engage emergency lockdown!<br />I hope you don't get seasick.</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.878" end="01:40:52.178">Do you?<br />Yeah.</p>
<p begin="01:40:52.180" end="01:40:53.446">Lieutenant, sound evacuation,<br />all decks.</p>

<p begin="01:40:56.118" end="01:40:59.185">As acting Captain, I order<br />you to abandon this ship.</p>
<p begin="01:41:00.988" end="01:41:03.123">I will remain behind<br />and divert all power</p>
<p begin="01:41:03.125" end="01:41:04.758">to life support<br />and evacuation shuttle bays.</p>

<p begin="01:41:06.328" end="01:41:09.162">I order you to<br />abandon the ship!</p>
<p begin="01:41:09.164" end="01:41:12.098">All due respect, Commander,<br />but we're not going anywhere.</p>

<p begin="01:41:36.424" end="01:41:38.057">There won't be time<br />for evacuation</p>
<p begin="01:41:38.059" end="01:41:41.327">if we don't get power<br />to stabilize the damn ship!</p>
<p begin="01:41:41.329" end="01:41:43.997">Can we restore it?<br />Only from engineering.</p>

<p begin="01:59:24.225" end="01:59:28.026">Your father was captain<br />of a starship for 12 minutes.</p>
<p begin="01:59:28.028" end="01:59:31.330">He saved 800 lives.<br />I dare you to do better.</p>
<p begin="01:59:41.140" end="01:59:44.176">Oh, don't be so melodramatic.<br />You were barely dead.</p>
<p begin="01:59:44.178" end="01:59:46.612">It was the transfusion<br />that really took its toll.</p>
<p begin="01:59:46.614" end="01:59:47.479">You were out cold<br />for two weeks.</p>
<p begin="01:59:47.481" end="01:59:49.181">Transfusion?</p>
<p begin="01:59:49.183" end="01:59:51.283">Your cells were heavily irradiated.<br />We had no choice.</p>

<p begin="01:59:55.189" end="01:59:57.923">I synthesized a serum<br />from his superblood.</p>
<p begin="01:59:57.925" end="02:00:00.259">Tell me, are you feeling,<br />uh, homicidal?</p>

<p begin="02:00:02.029" end="02:00:03.428">No more than usual.</p>
<p begin="02:00:04.163" end="02:00:05.097">How'd you catch him?</p>
<p begin="02:00:05.531" end="02:00:06.899">I didn't.</p>
<p begin="02:00:15.909" end="02:00:18.210">You saved my life.</p>
<p begin="02:00:18.212" end="02:00:20.373">Uhura and I had something to<br />do with it, too, you know.</p>
<p begin="02:00:22.282" end="02:00:24.416">You saved my life, Captain.<br />And the lives...</p>

<p begin="02:00:51.111" end="02:00:54.212">we risk awakening the same<br />evil within ourselves.</p>
<p begin="02:01:00.687" end="02:01:03.422">Our first instinct<br />is to seek revenge</p>

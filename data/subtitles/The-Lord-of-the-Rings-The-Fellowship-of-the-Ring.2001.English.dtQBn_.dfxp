<p begin="00:00:34.560" end="00:00:37.620">这世界改变了</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.800" end="00:00:40.830">我从水中触摸到</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.570" end="00:00:44.510">我从地上感觉到</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.080" end="00:00:49.070">我从空气中嗅到</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.480" end="00:00:51.380">过去的一切</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.580" end="00:00:53.140">都已失落</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.850" end="00:00:56.880">现在没有人记得了</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.800" end="00:01:14.170">这一切都从铸造魔戒开始</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.370" end="00:01:16.270">精灵族得到三只戒指</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.440" end="00:01:20.240">他们能够长生不老 也是最有智慧、最公平的种族</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.310" end="00:01:23.370">矮人族分到七只戒指</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.110" end="00:01:28.550">他们很会挖掘矿坑 是山洞的巧心工匠</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.020" end="00:01:30.250">而人类…</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.450" end="00:01:33.450">则分到九只戒指</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.690" end="00:01:37.520">他们比别人更贪图权力</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.990" end="00:01:38.590">中土世界</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.630" end="00:01:43.860">每只戒指都拥有 统治每个种族的力量</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.370" end="00:01:48.530">但他们都受到欺骗</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.770" end="00:01:50.860">因为还铸造了另一只</p>

<p begin="00:01:52.110" end="00:01:55.270">在魔多末日火山的烈焰中</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.710" end="00:02:00.150">黑暗魔君索伦 暗中铸造了可以奴役世界的…</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.380" end="00:02:02.410">至尊魔戒</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.620" end="00:02:06.580">他在至尊魔戒中 注入他的邪恶、残酷</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.790" end="00:02:10.990">以及统治天下的可怕欲望</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.960" end="00:02:15.860">一只驾驭一切的至尊魔戒</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.670" end="00:02:18.360">一个接一个</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.570" end="00:02:23.230">中土世界的自由之土 感受到至尊魔戒的力量</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.440" end="00:02:26.470">但是有些人群起反抗</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.940" end="00:02:31.610">组成了精灵和人类的最后同盟 对抗魔多的邪恶兵团</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.810" end="00:02:36.440">他们在险恶的末日火山 为中土世界的自由奋战</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.780" end="00:03:09.410">胜利终于在望</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.160" end="00:03:15.920">但是至尊魔戒的力量</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.730" end="00:03:18.160">无人能敌</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.750" end="00:03:44.690">就在这时候</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.890" end="00:03:47.250">当大家都失去希望之际</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.490" end="00:03:51.590">人皇之子埃西铎 拾起他父亲的宝剑</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.690" end="00:04:29.190">黑暗魔君索伦, 中土世界 自由人民之敌终于被击败</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.070" end="00:04:38.230">至尊魔戒落入埃西铎手中</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.440" end="00:04:42.640">他只有一次机会永远摧毁邪恶</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.380" end="00:04:45.510">但是人心</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.720" end="00:04:48.210">很容易受到蛊惑</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.450" end="00:04:53.080">而且至尊魔戒力量不受到控制</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.280" end="00:05:20.910">它背叛了埃西铎</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.750" end="00:05:25.150">最后害死了他</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.330" end="00:05:33.190">不该被遗忘的东西</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.430" end="00:05:35.760">也遗失了</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.600" end="00:05:38.790">历史成为传说</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.000" end="00:05:40.990">传说成为神话</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.200" end="00:05:44.100">两千五百年来</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.270" end="00:05:47.970">至尊魔戒的下落无人得知</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.610" end="00:05:51.440">命运巧妙的安排</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.110" end="00:05:55.210">让它蛊惑一个新的持有者</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.590" end="00:06:01.390">我的宝贝</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.660" end="00:06:04.180">至尊魔戒落入咕鲁手中</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.360" end="00:06:08.300">他把它带到迷雾山脉的洞穴中</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.600" end="00:06:11.460">他的身心完全被魔戒占据</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.670" end="00:06:13.690">它落到我手中</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.900" end="00:06:18.340">这是我的, 我的爱, 是我的</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.540" end="00:06:23.240">我的宝贝</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.880" end="00:06:30.320">它让咕鲁得到违反自然的长寿</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.520" end="00:06:34.350">五百年来它扭曲他的心智</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.560" end="00:06:39.150">它在咕鲁阴暗的洞穴中 静静地等待</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.360" end="00:06:42.630">黑暗再度笼罩大地</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.870" end="00:06:45.700">谣传东方升起邪恶力量</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.900" end="00:06:48.700">人们心中产生无比的恐惧</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.900" end="00:06:52.200">于是至尊魔戒知道</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.410" end="00:06:55.210">它即将再度现身</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.650" end="00:07:00.270">它舍弃了咕鲁</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.950" end="00:07:05.440">但是出乎至尊魔戒的意料之外</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.290" end="00:07:10.880">它被一个料想不到的人捡到</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.090" end="00:07:12.150">这是什么?</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.360" end="00:07:13.790">一个哈比人</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.960" end="00:07:16.730">夏尔的比尔博巴金斯</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.930" end="00:07:18.700">一只戒指</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.900" end="00:07:20.770">不见了!</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.540" end="00:07:26.980">我的宝贝不见了!</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.210" end="00:07:29.470">不久的将来</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.750" end="00:07:34.910">哈比人将决定世界的命运</p>

<p begin="00:08:55.330" end="00:08:57.320">数百年来</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.500" end="00:09:00.470">都乐于受到世人遗忘</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.670" end="00:09:03.830">也就是世上的其他人种</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.210" end="00:09:09.840">毕竟中土世界充满 不计其数的奇怪生物</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.010" end="00:09:13.210">哈比人的存在微不足道</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.380" end="00:09:17.410">他们并非骁勇善战的武士</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.590" end="00:09:21.780">也不算是聪明绝顶的智者</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.160" end="00:09:29.150">佛罗多, 有人在敲门</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.370" end="00:09:32.930">老实说, 有人说</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.100" end="00:09:37.540">哈比人唯一的热爱就是食物</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.910" end="00:09:40.100">但这是很不公平的说法</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.310" end="00:09:43.940">因为我们也很喜欢酿啤酒</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.380" end="00:09:47.110">和抽烟草</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.580" end="00:09:50.420">但是我们真正的最爱</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.620" end="00:09:52.710">就是和平宁静</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.420" end="00:09:55.620">还有肥沃的土地</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.820" end="00:10:00.960">每一个哈比人都热爱 从土里长出来的东西</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.130" end="00:10:08.540">别人一定会觉得 我们的日子过得太悠闲</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.700" end="00:10:13.940">但是今天更是印证了我的想法</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.540" end="00:10:20.480">能过朴实简单的生活 真的是一种幸福</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.650" end="00:10:22.140">生日快乐 比尔博巴金斯</p>

<p begin="00:10:41.270" end="00:10:44.800">外面风景多美丽</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.580" end="00:10:53.380">我要踏上这旅程</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.380" end="00:10:58.480">眼前道路无止尽</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.690" end="00:11:02.150">蜿蜒崎岖又漫长</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.390" end="00:11:07.330">虽然路程尚遥远</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.000" end="00:11:11.760">－我必须继续前进 －你迟到了</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.040" end="00:11:18.840">巫师绝对不会迟到 佛罗多巴金斯</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.640" end="00:11:24.270">也不会早到 他一定是按照计划准时到</p>

<p begin="00:11:42.560" end="00:11:46.300">我怎么会错过 你比尔博叔叔的生日?</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.000" end="00:11:50.130">那老不死还好吧?</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.670" end="00:11:54.200">听说生日宴会非常盛大</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.380" end="00:11:56.840">你也知道比尔博 他把这儿搞得鸡飞狗跳</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.010" end="00:11:58.980">这样他应该高兴了</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.150" end="00:12:01.010">夏尔有一半人都被邀请</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.250" end="00:12:03.880">另外一半也不请自来</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.060" end="00:12:10.390">夏尔的哈比人 如往常一样过着日子</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.560" end="00:12:13.590">从古到今都一样</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.760" end="00:12:19.330">自给自足、快乐幸福 没有什么太大的改变</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.500" end="00:12:21.400">也许也不会有所改变</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.670" end="00:12:26.110">因为夏尔的一切历久弥新</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.280" end="00:12:29.770">一代一代地传下去</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.210" end="00:12:35.170">巴金斯家族一直 都有成员住在山丘下的…</p>

<p begin="00:12:39.490" end="00:12:42.250">以后也一定会有</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.990" end="00:12:46.390">不过说实话 最近比尔博有点怪</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.630" end="00:12:49.860">跟以前比起来更古怪</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.900" end="00:12:52.760">他成天把自己关在书房</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.370" end="00:12:58.530">我每次趁他不注意偷看 都看到他总是在研究地图</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.250" end="00:13:12.910">它跑哪儿去了?</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.580" end="00:13:41.810">他一定在搞什么名堂</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.960" end="00:13:52.450">－好吧, 你不说拉倒 －什么?</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.660" end="00:13:54.360">我知道你一定脱不了关系</p>

<p begin="00:13:56.130" end="00:13:58.860">在你出现前 巴金斯家族一向都很规矩</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.130" end="00:13:59.960">这倒是真的</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.300" end="00:14:02.500">我们从不冒险或犯规</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.110" end="00:14:08.980">如果你指的是那只恶龙 那件事与我无关</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.180" end="00:14:12.770">我只是推了你叔叔一把</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.950" end="00:14:17.080">不管怎样 你都正式被列为捣乱份子</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.450" end="00:14:19.320">真的吗?</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.030" end="00:14:26.960">甘道夫! 甘道夫!</p>

<p begin="00:37:06.890" end="00:37:09.480">把手伸出来</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.660" end="00:37:10.820">很冰凉</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.330" end="00:37:16.090">你看到什么?</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.870" end="00:37:20.270">你看到什么吗?</p>

<p begin="00:37:28.110" end="00:37:29.600">等等</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.710" end="00:37:35.980">上面有刻痕</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.380" end="00:37:40.840">好像是精灵文, 我看不懂</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.060" end="00:37:43.620">很少人看得懂</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.190" end="00:37:49.030">这是魔多的古文字 我现在不能念出来</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.630" end="00:37:50.690">魔多!</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.000" end="00:37:52.990">它说的是</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.200" end="00:37:56.690">"至尊戒, 驭众戒</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.900" end="00:37:59.240">至尊戒, 寻众戒</p>

<p begin="00:38:06.580" end="00:38:08.610">这只至尊魔戒</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.820" end="00:38:14.080">是黑暗魔君索伦 用末日火山的烈焰铸成</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.290" end="00:38:18.320">埃西铎从索伦手中夺过来</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.090" end="00:38:21.650">比尔博找到它</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.100" end="00:38:24.060">－在咕鲁的洞穴中 －是的</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.270" end="00:38:28.790">比尔博六十年来 不动声色持有至尊魔戒</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.040" end="00:38:32.400">他因此而延长了寿命 延迟了老化</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.070" end="00:38:37.440">但是状况已经改变了 邪恶在魔多蠢蠢欲动</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.650" end="00:38:40.080">至尊魔戒被唤醒了</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.280" end="00:38:43.050">它听到主人的召唤</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.250" end="00:38:47.120">但是索伦已经被消灭了</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.830" end="00:38:54.920">不, 佛罗多</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.860" end="00:38:59.160">索伦的灵魂没有死</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.370" end="00:39:04.700">他的生命和至尊魔戒紧紧相系</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.970" end="00:39:07.170">至尊魔戒仍然幸存</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.110" end="00:39:10.170">他的半兽人大军与日俱增</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.380" end="00:39:14.440">他在魔多也重建了要塞巴拉多</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.620" end="00:39:19.380">索伦只要得到至尊魔戒 就能让黑暗再度笼罩大地</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.620" end="00:39:21.650">他在搜寻至尊魔戒</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.860" end="00:39:25.720">全心全意、不择手段地搜寻</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.960" end="00:39:28.660">同时至尊魔戒也渴望</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.860" end="00:39:32.300">回到它主人的手中</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.500" end="00:39:34.300">他们本为一体</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.470" end="00:39:37.560">至尊魔戒和黑暗魔君</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.740" end="00:39:38.800">佛罗多</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.340" end="00:39:41.240">绝对不能让他找到至尊魔戒</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.410" end="00:39:42.470">好</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.810" end="00:39:47.140">那就把它藏起来再也不提</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.310" end="00:39:49.980">没人知道它在这儿, 是吧?</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.660" end="00:39:56.850">是不是? 甘道夫</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.890" end="00:40:01.330">有一个人知道 比尔博得到至尊魔戒</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.530" end="00:40:05.560">我到处在找咕鲁</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.770" end="00:40:07.890">但是魔君先找到他</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.670" end="00:40:12.160">他不晓得被拷打了多久</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.340" end="00:40:16.830">但是在可怕的哀嚎和呻吟声中 他们听出两个名字:</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.010" end="00:40:19.170">夏尔</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.350" end="00:40:20.940">巴金斯</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.180" end="00:40:23.010">夏尔</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.180" end="00:40:26.050">巴金斯 他们会找到这里来</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.790" end="00:40:29.920">什么人?</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.690" end="00:40:32.890">你拿去, 甘道夫</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.290" end="00:40:34.350">－拿去 －不行</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.530" end="00:40:36.890">－你一定要拿去 －你不能把魔戒给我</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.100" end="00:40:40.430">－我要把它给你 －别引诱我, 佛罗多</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.970" end="00:40:44.200">我不敢拿</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.540" end="00:40:46.970">我更不能保护它</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.080" end="00:40:50.100">你要了解</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.780" end="00:40:54.410">我只希望利用至尊魔戒行善事</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.820" end="00:41:05.550">但是它透过我 将释放无法想像的邪恶力量</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.130" end="00:41:09.060">－它不能留在这儿 －没错</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.930" end="00:41:12.560">的确不能</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.910" end="00:41:19.270">我该怎么做?</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.940" end="00:41:24.470">－你一定要尽快离开 －我该去哪里?</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.710" end="00:41:27.940">离开这儿, 赶到布理村</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.250" end="00:41:29.310">布理</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.520" end="00:41:32.280">－那你呢? －我会等你</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.490" end="00:41:34.950">在跃马旅店</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.160" end="00:41:38.920">－魔戒在那儿安全吗? －我不知道, 佛罗多</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.090" end="00:41:41.080">我无法回答你</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.600" end="00:41:48.130">我必须去见巫师长 他有智慧及力量, 相信我</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.340" end="00:41:50.460">他知道该怎么做</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.100" end="00:41:53.940">你不能用巴金斯这名字</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.140" end="00:41:56.630">这名字在夏尔之外不安全</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.310" end="00:42:00.610">白天赶路, 别走大道</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.280" end="00:42:04.440">我可以穿过农田</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.950" end="00:42:08.290">好孩子</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.560" end="00:42:11.620">哈比人真不可思议</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.790" end="00:42:14.690">只要一个月 就能了解他们</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.900" end="00:42:17.300">但一百年后</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.460" end="00:42:19.490">他们仍然让你吃惊不已</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.130" end="00:42:22.470">趴下来</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.680" end="00:42:38.170">可恶的山姆卫斯詹吉 你一直在偷听吗?</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.350" end="00:42:42.850">我才没有偷听什么 我只是在窗外除草而已</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.020" end="00:42:45.490">现在除草未免太晚了</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.660" end="00:42:48.530">－我听到说话声 －你听到什么? 快说</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.700" end="00:42:49.820">没什么啦</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.360" end="00:42:54.490">我听到戒指 黑暗魔君和世界末日</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.670" end="00:42:59.400">甘道夫大爷, 别伤害我 别把我变成死的东西</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.110" end="00:43:01.730">不要吗?</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.940" end="00:43:04.070">也许不会</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.350" end="00:43:08.750">你有更好的用处</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.520" end="00:43:13.510">快点, 山姆, 跟上来</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.020" end="00:43:17.220">你们千万要小心</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.520" end="00:43:20.250">敌人有很多眼线</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.530" end="00:43:23.430">包括飞鸟野兽</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.200" end="00:43:27.030">魔戒呢?</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.700" end="00:43:30.070">千万别戴上它</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.270" end="00:43:33.710">黑暗魔君的爪牙会被吸引来</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.870" end="00:43:35.360">你要记住</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.880" end="00:43:39.040">至尊魔戒想要回到主人手上</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.410" end="00:44:24.320">它想要被找到 就是这样</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.660" end="00:44:26.790">这是什么?</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.130" end="00:44:29.190">我只要再跨一步</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.700" end="00:44:33.600">就是我离家最远的一次</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.800" end="00:44:39.290">走吧, 山姆</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.780" end="00:44:49.610">我记得比尔博总是说 :</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.150" end="00:44:53.950">－"旅行很危险" －"一旦你出了门上了路</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.120" end="00:44:58.560">如果你不专心看路</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.730" end="00:45:02.920">谁晓得你会被带到哪里去"</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.740" end="00:45:18.570">山姆</p>

<p begin="00:45:41.000" end="00:45:42.730">他们要去灰港岸</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.340" end="00:45:45.360">他们要离开中土世界</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.540" end="00:45:47.730">永远不再回来</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.680" end="00:45:52.740">我不知道为什么</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.480" end="00:45:55.850">我会感到这么悲伤</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.880" end="00:46:02.550">地上到处都是盘根错节 把我的背顶得好疼</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.260" end="00:46:05.020">闭上眼睛</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.190" end="00:46:07.960">想像你躺在自己的床上</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.130" end="00:46:12.060">舒服的床垫和柔软的羽毛枕头</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.370" end="00:46:24.070">这没有用, 佛罗多</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.240" end="00:46:27.110">我在荒郊野外永远都睡不著</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.450" end="00:46:31.820">我也睡不著</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.310" end="00:47:03.410">末日火山再度升起烟硝</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.580" end="00:47:05.240">时间不多了</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.420" end="00:47:08.980">灰袍巫师甘道夫赶到艾辛格</p>

<p begin="01:34:29.090" end="01:34:31.320">它还是很锐利</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.270" end="01:34:43.300">但现在它只是残缺的宝物</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.130" end="01:35:13.160">你为什么害怕过去?</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.040" end="01:35:19.440">虽然你是埃西铎的后代 但你并不是他</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.640" end="01:35:23.040">你不会重蹈他的覆辙</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.580" end="01:35:27.540">我身上流着跟他一样的血</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.590" end="01:35:33.150">一样的软弱</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.860" end="01:35:38.660">你的荣耀即将来临</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.830" end="01:35:43.230">你会面对同样的邪恶 然后击败它</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.470" end="01:35:48.870">邪恶的力量并没有征服我们</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.870" end="01:35:53.470">至少你我还没被征服</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.860" end="01:36:08.050">你记得我们第一次见面吗?</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.600" end="01:36:16.120">我好像走进了一个梦境</p>
<p begin="01:36:16.700" end="01:36:19.190">过了这么多年</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.900" end="01:36:24.270">你不再像当初一样年少轻狂</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.740" end="01:36:27.770">你还记得当初我说什么吗?</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.750" end="01:36:36.450">你说你愿意嫁给我</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.520" end="01:36:43.460">放弃精灵长生不死的力量</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.560" end="01:36:46.550">我仍愿意这么做</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.730" end="01:36:50.330">我宁愿和你共度一生</p>
<p begin="01:36:50.570" end="01:36:54.400">也不愿意面对永生不死的孤寂</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.180" end="01:37:06.640">我选择成为凡人</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.990" end="01:37:12.250">－你不能给我这个 －这是我的选择</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.460" end="01:37:17.980">像是我的心</p>
<p begin="01:37:33.810" end="01:37:37.470">来自远方的陌生人和老朋友</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.680" end="01:37:41.640">你们要商量如何对抗魔多</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.290" end="01:37:47.160">中土世界正面临灭亡的命运 无人能幸免</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.360" end="01:37:50.880">你们不团结一心就会遭到毁灭</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.130" end="01:37:55.360">每一个种族都无法幸免</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.230" end="01:38:00.730">把魔戒拿上来, 佛罗多</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.820" end="01:38:16.510">这果然是真的</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.000" end="01:38:36.060">我曾经在梦中</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.710" end="01:38:40.910">看到东方的天空暗淡</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.210" end="01:38:42.910">但是西方却只有一线微光</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.710" end="01:38:45.510">有一个声音在呐喊:</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.750" end="01:38:48.680">" 你即将面临灭亡的命运</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.690" end="01:38:52.420">埃西铎克星已被寻获 "</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.460" end="01:38:58.260">埃西铎克星</p>
<p begin="01:38:58.860" end="01:39:00.160">波罗莫</p>
<p begin="01:39:23.290" end="01:39:27.120">没有人敢在瑞文戴尔 说出魔多的邪恶语言</p>
<p begin="01:39:27.290" end="01:39:31.060">我并不想请求你的原谅 爱隆王</p>
<p begin="01:39:31.230" end="01:39:33.320">因为魔多的邪恶魔音</p>
<p begin="01:39:33.600" end="01:39:35.000">也许很快就会</p>
<p begin="01:39:35.200" end="01:39:38.130">响彻整个西方世界</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.300" end="01:39:41.000">魔戒是一种邪恶力量</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.310" end="01:39:42.830">它是一个礼物</p>
<p begin="01:39:43.440" end="01:39:45.500">一个对抗魔多的利器</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.110" end="01:39:48.240">何不利用这只魔戒?</p>
<p begin="01:39:48.450" end="01:39:51.210">我父亲是刚铎的宰相</p>
<p begin="01:39:51.420" end="01:39:55.750">他一直奋力和魔多抗争 我们流着鲜血…</p>
<p begin="01:39:55.990" end="01:39:58.250">保护你们的安全</p>
<p begin="01:39:59.990" end="01:40:04.360">把敌人的武器交给刚铎 让我们利用它来对抗邪恶</p>
<p begin="01:40:04.590" end="01:40:08.330">你无法驾驭它, 谁都不能</p>
<p begin="01:40:08.930" end="01:40:12.990">至尊魔戒的主人是索伦 它没有第二个主人</p>
<p begin="01:40:13.240" end="01:40:16.760">区区一个游侠懂什么?</p>
<p begin="01:40:17.040" end="01:40:19.030">他不只是游侠</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.010" end="01:40:23.670">他是亚拉冈, 亚拉松之子</p>
<p begin="01:40:24.180" end="01:40:27.120">你要对他效忠</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.190" end="01:40:33.120">亚拉冈</p>
<p begin="01:40:34.890" end="01:40:37.690">你是埃西铎的后代</p>
<p begin="01:40:40.030" end="01:40:42.790">也是刚铎的王位继承人</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.900" end="01:40:46.370">坐下来, 勒苟拉斯</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.670" end="01:40:52.510">刚铎没有国王</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.380" end="01:40:56.070">刚铎也不需要国王</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.790" end="01:41:06.420">亚拉冈说得对, 不能利用魔戒</p>
<p begin="01:41:07.420" end="01:41:10.920">你们只有一个选择</p>
<p begin="01:41:11.160" end="01:41:13.490">一定要摧毁至尊魔戒</p>
<p begin="01:41:18.740" end="01:41:21.330">那还等什么?</p>
<p begin="01:41:33.420" end="01:41:36.440">金雳, 葛罗音之子 在场的任何武器…</p>
<p begin="01:41:36.690" end="01:41:40.880">都无法摧毁至尊魔戒</p>
<p begin="01:41:41.430" end="01:41:45.560">魔戒是末日火山的烈焰铸成</p>
<p begin="01:41:45.760" end="01:41:49.600">也只有在那儿才能摧毁它</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.700" end="01:41:53.260">一定要深入魔多</p>
<p begin="01:41:53.470" end="01:41:58.430">把魔戒丢到末日火山的烈焰中</p>
<p begin="01:42:00.440" end="01:42:02.440">你们其中一个</p>
<p begin="01:42:02.950" end="01:42:05.110">必须去做</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.050" end="01:42:11.750">我们不能就这样闯进魔多</p>
<p begin="01:42:12.660" end="01:42:16.290">除了有半兽人看守黑色大门</p>
<p begin="01:42:17.130" end="01:42:21.260">还有永不松懈的邪恶力量</p>
<p begin="01:42:21.470" end="01:42:25.730">索伦的邪眼更是虎视耽耽</p>
<p begin="01:42:26.470" end="01:42:28.500">那是一片死寂的荒原</p>
<p begin="01:42:28.740" end="01:42:32.300">布满烈焰、灰烬和尘埃</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.510" end="01:42:36.380">光是空中就充满致命毒气</p>
<p begin="01:42:36.580" end="01:42:40.880">就算有千军万马也办不到 这是不可能的</p>
<p begin="01:42:41.080" end="01:42:45.580">你没听到爱隆王说的话吗? 一定要摧毁魔戒</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.760" end="01:42:48.320">难道你要自告奋勇吗?</p>
<p begin="01:42:48.530" end="01:42:53.190">失败了怎么办? 魔戒被索伦抢回去怎么办?</p>
<p begin="01:42:53.430" end="01:42:58.660">我绝不容许魔戒落入精灵手中</p>
<p begin="01:43:00.670" end="01:43:03.160">精灵都不可靠</p>
<p begin="01:43:04.340" end="01:43:10.180">大家在这儿争吵不休 索伦的力量就会越来越强</p>
<p begin="01:43:10.510" end="01:43:13.420">每个人都会遭到毁灭</p>
<p begin="01:43:32.170" end="01:43:34.430">我愿意</p>
<p begin="01:43:36.370" end="01:43:38.930">我愿意去</p>
<p begin="01:43:44.710" end="01:43:47.810">我愿意把魔戒带到魔多</p>
<p begin="01:43:55.890" end="01:43:57.150">虽然…</p>
<p begin="01:44:00.260" end="01:44:02.060">我不认得路</p>
<p begin="01:44:04.100" end="01:44:08.400">我愿意协助你, 佛罗多巴金斯</p>
<p begin="01:44:08.610" end="01:44:12.010">只要你愿背负重担</p>
<p begin="01:44:13.110" end="01:44:16.170">我愿意牺牲性命保护你的安危</p>
<p begin="01:44:16.910" end="01:44:18.240">我愿意</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.520" end="01:44:23.780">我的剑会保护你</p>
<p begin="01:44:25.590" end="01:44:27.680">还有我的弓箭</p>
<p begin="01:44:28.260" end="01:44:30.750">以及我的斧头</p>
<p begin="01:44:37.770" end="01:44:40.760">你背负着大家的命运</p>
<p begin="01:44:42.770" end="01:44:46.440">如果这是大家的决定</p>
<p begin="01:44:46.910" end="01:44:49.380">刚铎也会支持他</p>
<p begin="01:44:51.950" end="01:44:56.720">－佛罗多先生到哪儿我都要跟去 －没错, 是很难拆散你们</p>
<p begin="01:44:56.920" end="01:45:01.790">连你没份参加的秘密会议 你也跟来了</p>
<p begin="01:45:02.390" end="01:45:04.290">我们也要跟去</p>
<p begin="01:45:06.300" end="01:45:09.090">除非你把我们五花大绑送回家</p>
<p begin="01:45:09.300" end="01:45:12.670">你需要聪明人来完成这…</p>
<p begin="01:45:13.040" end="01:45:14.300">任务</p>
<p begin="01:45:14.540" end="01:45:15.970">或是冒险</p>
<p begin="01:45:16.440" end="01:45:17.460">这玩意</p>
<p begin="01:45:19.340" end="01:45:22.070">你第一个就不合格</p>
<p begin="01:45:23.610" end="01:45:25.550">九名同伴</p>
<p begin="01:45:27.320" end="01:45:29.150">就这样吧</p>
<p begin="01:45:29.490" end="01:45:32.550">你们就是魔戒远征队</p>
<p begin="01:45:33.160" end="01:45:34.990">帅呆了</p>
<p begin="01:45:35.260" end="01:45:37.490">我们要去哪儿呀?</p>
<p begin="01:46:13.040" end="01:46:15.560">她希望保护她的孩子</p>
<p begin="01:46:17.410" end="01:46:21.180">她以为你在瑞文戴尔会很安全</p>
<p begin="01:46:23.350" end="01:46:26.840">你母亲知道 你这辈子都会遭到追杀</p>
<p begin="01:46:27.320" end="01:46:29.050">你也逃避不了这个命运</p>
<p begin="01:46:29.590" end="01:46:33.180">精灵可以重新铸造王者之剑</p>
<p begin="01:46:33.630" end="01:46:37.560">但是只有你 拥有使用它的力量</p>
<p begin="01:46:38.600" end="01:46:41.030">我并不想拥有这力量</p>
<p begin="01:46:41.200" end="01:46:43.930">我从来都不想</p>
<p begin="01:46:45.200" end="01:46:47.800">你是唯一的人皇继承人 没有别人了</p>
<p begin="01:46:52.350" end="01:46:54.680">这是我的宝剑, 刺针</p>
<p begin="01:46:54.880" end="01:46:56.080">来, 拿去</p>
<p begin="01:47:01.590" end="01:47:05.460">－好轻哦 －没错, 这是精灵宝剑</p>
<p begin="01:47:06.160" end="01:47:10.320">半兽人接近剑身就会发亮</p>
<p begin="01:47:10.530" end="01:47:15.130">这样一来你就知道要格外小心</p>
<p begin="01:47:15.340" end="01:47:17.800">这玩意更棒</p>
<p begin="01:47:18.200" end="01:47:19.500">秘银</p>
<p begin="01:47:20.310" end="01:47:24.680">轻若鸿毛、韧如龙鳞</p>
<p begin="01:47:24.880" end="01:47:28.140">让我看你把它穿上, 快点</p>
<p begin="01:47:36.190" end="01:47:38.210">我的戒指</p>
<p begin="01:47:39.490" end="01:47:43.390">我真的很想…</p>

<p begin="01:48:05.020" end="01:48:08.680">我很抱歉把你卷进这件事</p>
<p begin="01:48:09.020" end="01:48:13.080">我很抱歉让你扛这重担</p>
<p begin="01:48:17.600" end="01:48:20.690">我对这一切都很抱歉</p>
<p begin="01:48:35.880" end="01:48:40.290">魔戒持有者要前往末日火山</p>
<p begin="01:48:41.220" end="01:48:43.810">你们这些同行的伙伴 并没有许下誓言…</p>
<p begin="01:48:44.060" end="01:48:47.180">或是受到约束 规定你们一定要走完全程</p>
<p begin="01:48:50.600" end="01:48:53.120">再会了, 别忘记你们的任务</p>
<p begin="01:48:53.600" end="01:48:57.500">愿精灵、人类 以及所有的自由之士</p>
<p begin="01:48:58.070" end="01:49:00.700">都能祝福你们</p>

<p begin="01:49:29.300" end="01:49:31.130">往左</p>
<p begin="01:50:50.750" end="01:50:55.190">我们必须向 迷雾山脉以西走四十天</p>
<p begin="01:50:55.390" end="01:50:59.120">幸运的话就能赶到洛汗隘口</p>
<p begin="01:50:59.360" end="01:51:02.920">从那儿往东走到魔多</p>
<p begin="01:51:03.100" end="01:51:06.930">二、一、五, 好! 非常好</p>

<p begin="01:51:21.550" end="01:51:24.610">我们大可以穿过摩瑞亚矿坑</p>
<p begin="01:51:25.250" end="01:51:29.120">我表哥巴林会热烈欢迎我们</p>
<p begin="01:51:29.360" end="01:51:34.660">不行 别无选择才能走摩瑞亚矿坑</p>
<p begin="01:51:43.940" end="01:51:45.100">对不起</p>
<p begin="01:51:45.810" end="01:51:47.300">抓住他</p>

<p begin="01:51:57.920" end="01:51:59.510">你抓住我了</p>
<p begin="01:51:59.990" end="01:52:02.610">－那是什么? －只是一朵乌云</p>
<p begin="01:52:02.820" end="01:52:05.520">它迎着风</p>
<p begin="01:52:05.790" end="01:52:07.950">移动得很快</p>

<p begin="01:52:54.070" end="01:52:57.440">我们一定要攀越卡兰拉斯山</p>

<p begin="01:54:40.950" end="01:54:45.650">甘道夫, 你想带他们 攀越卡兰拉斯山</p>

<p begin="01:55:11.710" end="01:55:14.650">空中有可怕的声音</p>
<p begin="01:55:15.710" end="01:55:17.200">那是萨鲁曼</p>

<p begin="01:56:53.680" end="01:56:56.480">让我们穿过摩瑞亚矿坑</p>
<p begin="01:56:58.320" end="01:57:02.190">摩瑞亚? 你很怕穿过矿坑</p>
<p begin="01:57:02.820" end="01:57:07.880">矮人太贪心, 挖得太深</p>
<p begin="01:57:08.690" end="01:57:13.560">你知道他们在 凯撒督姆的黑暗中唤醒什么</p>
<p begin="01:57:14.830" end="01:57:18.330">邪恶的炎魔</p>

<p begin="01:58:01.150" end="01:58:04.380">－好多了 －魔戒呢?</p>
<p begin="01:58:05.990" end="01:58:08.480">你感觉到它的力量 越来越大, 对吧?</p>
<p begin="01:58:08.950" end="01:58:11.860">我也感觉到了, 你要千万小心</p>
<p begin="01:58:12.320" end="01:58:16.190">邪恶力量不但会来自外面</p>
<p begin="01:58:16.360" end="01:58:18.960">恐怕也会来自远征队员</p>
<p begin="01:58:21.570" end="01:58:25.730">－我该相信谁? －你要相信自己</p>
<p begin="01:58:25.900" end="01:58:28.810">相信自己的力量</p>
<p begin="01:58:28.970" end="01:58:31.530">－什么意思? －这世上有很多力量</p>
<p begin="01:58:31.710" end="01:58:33.800">正义或邪恶的力量</p>
<p begin="01:58:33.980" end="01:58:36.280">有些力量比我更大</p>

<p begin="01:58:41.850" end="01:58:43.190">摩瑞亚矿坑的…</p>
<p begin="01:58:43.890" end="01:58:45.980">墙</p>
<p begin="01:58:51.700" end="01:58:54.690">矮人打造的门 关起来是看不到的</p>
<p begin="01:58:54.900" end="01:58:59.360">没错, 如果秘密被遗忘 连它们的主人都找不到</p>
<p begin="01:58:59.710" end="01:59:02.170">我怎么一点都不吃惊?</p>
<p begin="01:59:10.180" end="01:59:13.520">让我看看</p>
<p begin="01:59:13.750" end="01:59:15.120">伊希尔丁金属</p>
<p begin="01:59:15.750" end="01:59:19.120">它只会反射星光和月光</p>
<p begin="01:59:33.210" end="01:59:37.270">上面写着: "都灵之门、摩瑞亚之主"</p>
<p begin="01:59:37.880" end="01:59:42.470">－开口说, 朋友, 然后进入 －那是什么意思?</p>
<p begin="01:59:42.710" end="01:59:47.450">很简单 如果是朋友, 说出暗语门就开了</p>
<p begin="02:00:11.240" end="02:00:12.370">没有反应</p>
<p begin="02:00:19.380" end="02:00:23.620">我以前知道所有精灵和人类</p>
<p begin="02:00:23.890" end="02:00:26.650">甚至是半兽人的咒语</p>
<p begin="02:00:26.960" end="02:00:28.150">你打算怎么办?</p>
<p begin="02:00:28.430" end="02:00:30.620">用你的头把大门撞开</p>
<p begin="02:00:30.900" end="02:00:32.830">要是这样还撞不开</p>
<p begin="02:00:33.030" end="02:00:35.760">你就别再烦我 让我静下来好好想一想</p>
<p begin="02:00:35.930" end="02:00:39.390">该用什么咒语才能开门</p>
<p begin="02:00:52.220" end="02:00:54.780">马儿不能进入矿坑</p>
<p begin="02:00:55.050" end="02:00:59.150">－就算它很勇敢也不行 －再见了, 比尔</p>
<p begin="02:01:00.330" end="02:01:03.120">去吧, 比尔</p>
<p begin="02:01:03.660" end="02:01:07.190">放心, 它认得回家的路</p>
<p begin="02:01:14.010" end="02:01:16.570">别玩水</p>
<p begin="02:01:16.810" end="02:01:18.670">没有用</p>
<p begin="02:01:31.360" end="02:01:33.520">这是一个谜语</p>
<p begin="02:01:36.260" end="02:01:39.390">开口说 "朋友", 然后进入</p>
<p begin="02:01:39.770" end="02:01:42.700">"朋友" 的精灵话怎么说?</p>
<p begin="02:01:44.100" end="02:01:45.400">(精灵语)</p>
<p begin="02:02:03.490" end="02:02:08.360">你很快就会见到矮人族的热情</p>
<p begin="02:02:08.790" end="02:02:14.530">熊熊的火焰、清凉的啤酒 大块的烤肉</p>
<p begin="02:02:16.030" end="02:02:19.090">这就是我表哥巴林的家</p>
<p begin="02:02:19.440" end="02:02:21.870">这怎么会只是矿坑呢?</p>
<p begin="02:02:22.070" end="02:02:24.040">当然不是</p>
<p begin="02:02:25.080" end="02:02:28.410">这不是矿坑, 这是坟墓</p>
<p begin="02:02:34.550" end="02:02:36.110">不…</p>
<p begin="02:02:37.390" end="02:02:39.050">不!</p>
<p begin="02:02:41.660" end="02:02:43.220">半兽人</p>
<p begin="02:02:47.130" end="02:02:51.430">我们应该去洛汗隘口 不应该来这儿</p>
<p begin="02:02:52.470" end="02:02:55.070">快走, 快呀</p>
<p begin="02:02:57.840" end="02:03:00.240">－佛罗多 －救命呀</p>
<p begin="02:03:00.450" end="02:03:02.070">神行客</p>

<p begin="02:04:11.420" end="02:04:15.010">现在只有一个选择</p>
<p begin="02:04:15.220" end="02:04:20.120">我们一定要穿过黑暗的矿坑</p>
<p begin="02:04:20.360" end="02:04:22.330">大家要提高警觉</p>
<p begin="02:04:22.530" end="02:04:25.990">有比半兽人更可怕的怪物</p>
<p begin="02:04:26.160" end="02:04:29.690">在这个黑暗的地底世界</p>
<p begin="02:04:37.680" end="02:04:41.580">安静, 要走四天才能到另一边</p>
<p begin="02:04:41.780" end="02:04:45.650">希望我们不会惊动什么</p>
<p begin="02:05:31.430" end="02:05:35.130">摩瑞亚矿坑最珍贵的不是黄金</p>
<p begin="02:05:35.300" end="02:05:37.730">或是珠宝</p>
<p begin="02:05:37.900" end="02:05:40.930">而是秘银</p>
<p begin="02:05:59.290" end="02:06:04.160">索林给了比尔博一件 秘银打造的锁甲</p>
<p begin="02:06:04.430" end="02:06:08.370">－简直是给国王的礼物 －没错</p>
<p begin="02:06:08.530" end="02:06:10.470">我从来没跟他说过</p>
<p begin="02:06:10.640" end="02:06:15.600">但那件秘银价值连城 可以买下整个夏尔</p>

<p begin="02:06:50.010" end="02:06:52.980">我不记得这地方</p>
<p begin="02:06:55.010" end="02:06:56.480">－我们迷路了吗? －没有</p>
<p begin="02:06:56.650" end="02:06:59.170">－应该迷路了 －甘道夫正在想</p>
<p begin="02:06:59.380" end="02:07:00.850">－梅里? －干嘛?</p>
<p begin="02:07:01.050" end="02:07:02.990">我饿了</p>
<p begin="02:07:14.370" end="02:07:18.800">－下面有东西 －那是咕鲁</p>
<p begin="02:07:19.000" end="02:07:23.100">－咕鲁? －他跟了我们三天</p>
<p begin="02:07:23.340" end="02:07:27.510">－他从巴拉多的地牢逃出来? －逃出来…</p>
<p begin="02:07:28.210" end="02:07:29.840">或是被放出来吧</p>
<p begin="02:07:30.380" end="02:07:34.010">他是为了魔戒而来</p>
<p begin="02:07:36.620" end="02:07:39.420">他对魔戒永远充满渴望</p>
<p begin="02:07:39.590" end="02:07:45.290">他对至尊魔戒又爱又恨 就像他对自己爱恨交加</p>
<p begin="02:07:45.460" end="02:07:50.370">史麦戈的遭遇很悲惨</p>
<p begin="02:07:50.540" end="02:07:56.470">史麦戈是咕鲁的本名 在他找到魔戒之前</p>
<p begin="02:07:57.440" end="02:08:00.240">在魔戒让他发疯之前</p>
<p begin="02:08:00.480" end="02:08:03.380">可惜比尔博没杀了他</p>
<p begin="02:08:03.580" end="02:08:04.780">可惜?</p>
<p begin="02:08:05.850" end="02:08:08.790">比尔博是可怜他才没杀他</p>
<p begin="02:08:09.650" end="02:08:14.890">有很多活人本来就该死 也有些死人本来命不该</p>
<p begin="02:08:16.360" end="02:08:18.800">你能做这种判断吗? 佛罗多?</p>
<p begin="02:08:21.230" end="02:08:25.170">千万别轻易断定别人的生死</p>
<p begin="02:08:25.400" end="02:08:28.300">就连智者都无法决定命运</p>
<p begin="02:08:28.910" end="02:08:34.810">我直觉地认为不管是好是坏 咕鲁都会跟这趟冒险有关…</p>
<p begin="02:08:35.610" end="02:08:38.480">在一切结束前</p>
<p begin="02:08:39.990" end="02:08:43.820">比尔博一时心软影响了很多人</p>
<p begin="02:08:50.500" end="02:08:53.830">我真希望魔戒没在我手中</p>
<p begin="02:08:55.270" end="02:08:57.330">真希望这一切都没发生</p>
<p begin="02:08:57.500" end="02:09:02.530">每个人遇到难关都会这么想 但是我们无法决定自己的命运</p>
<p begin="02:09:03.340" end="02:09:08.840">我们要决定的是 在一定的时间内怎么去做</p>
<p begin="02:09:10.350" end="02:09:14.340">世上除了邪恶还有别的力量</p>
<p begin="02:09:14.720" end="02:09:17.190">比尔博注定要找到魔戒</p>
<p begin="02:09:17.690" end="02:09:22.020">你也注定要得到它</p>
<p begin="02:09:22.260" end="02:09:25.350">能这么想就好了</p>
<p begin="02:09:30.240" end="02:09:32.200">这个方向</p>
<p begin="02:09:32.470" end="02:09:34.770">－他记起来了 －不是</p>
<p begin="02:09:34.970" end="02:09:38.770">但是这儿的空气没那么糟</p>
<p begin="02:09:38.980" end="02:09:44.180">要是迷了路跟着鼻子走就对了</p>

<p begin="02:21:58.950" end="02:22:02.080">远古的恶魔</p>
<p begin="02:22:04.290" end="02:22:06.720">你们都不是它的对手</p>
<p begin="02:22:07.890" end="02:22:09.450">快跑</p>

<p begin="02:30:06.440" end="02:30:09.000">跟紧了</p>
<p begin="02:30:09.740" end="02:30:13.870">听说这儿住了可怕的女巫师</p>
<p begin="02:30:14.080" end="02:30:16.640">她是一个精灵</p>
<p begin="02:30:17.180" end="02:30:20.050">拥有强大法力</p>
<p begin="02:30:20.580" end="02:30:22.780">只要看她一眼</p>
<p begin="02:30:23.020" end="02:30:24.780">就会被她蛊惑</p>

<p begin="02:30:28.560" end="02:30:30.580">然后永远消失</p>
<p begin="02:30:30.790" end="02:30:35.290">你来到这里 带来毁灭的消息</p>
<p begin="02:30:35.530" end="02:30:39.230">你把邪恶带来, 魔戒持有者</p>
<p begin="02:30:39.440" end="02:30:41.200">佛罗多先生?</p>
<p begin="02:30:46.480" end="02:30:52.070">她可骗不了我这矮人</p>
<p begin="02:30:52.280" end="02:30:56.810">我有老鹰的锐眼、狐狸的耳朵</p>
<p begin="02:31:04.490" end="02:31:09.090">这矮子太聒噪 就算闭着眼睛也能毙了他</p>
<p begin="02:31:14.240" end="02:31:16.230">欢迎, 勒苟拉斯, 瑟兰督伊之子</p>
<p begin="02:31:17.140" end="02:31:19.800">魔戒远征队需要你帮忙</p>
<p begin="02:31:22.610" end="02:31:24.310">登丹人亚拉冈</p>
<p begin="02:31:24.950" end="02:31:26.350">我们久仰你的大名</p>
<p begin="02:31:27.250" end="02:31:29.510">你们精灵 不是一向都很有礼貌吗?</p>
<p begin="02:31:29.720" end="02:31:31.620">说我们也听得懂的话</p>
<p begin="02:31:31.790" end="02:31:36.350">自从黑暗时期 我们就没跟矮人打过交道</p>
<p begin="02:31:36.630" end="02:31:39.150">你知道我这矮人会怎么说吗?</p>
<p begin="02:31:46.000" end="02:31:47.970">你这样很没有礼貌</p>
<p begin="02:31:54.510" end="02:31:58.540">你们带来强大的邪恶力量</p>
<p begin="02:32:00.320" end="02:32:02.510">你们不能再前进</p>
<p begin="02:32:39.920" end="02:32:42.550">你不能让甘道夫白白牺牲</p>
<p begin="02:32:43.690" end="02:32:45.590">他也不会要你放弃希望</p>
<p begin="02:32:47.100" end="02:32:50.430">你身负重任, 佛罗多</p>
<p begin="02:32:51.300" end="02:32:54.400">千万别被死亡的阴影打败</p>
<p begin="02:32:57.240" end="02:32:59.300">跟我来</p>
<p begin="02:33:11.020" end="02:33:12.960">卡拉斯加拉顿</p>
<p begin="02:33:13.590" end="02:33:16.560">黄金森林中的精灵城市</p>
<p begin="02:33:16.730" end="02:33:22.390">凯勒布理安公主 以及光明女王凯兰崔尔的国度</p>
<p begin="02:34:41.510" end="02:34:44.610">敌人知道你们来到这里</p>
<p begin="02:34:45.280" end="02:34:50.450">你们已经曝露了行踪</p>
<p begin="02:34:52.190" end="02:34:56.630">这儿只有八人 但有九人从瑞文戴尔出发</p>
<p begin="02:34:56.860" end="02:34:58.690">甘道夫呢?</p>
<p begin="02:34:58.860" end="02:35:01.990">我想跟他说话</p>
<p begin="02:35:02.170" end="02:35:04.960">我在这儿看不到他</p>
<p begin="02:35:05.840" end="02:35:11.000">灰袍巫师甘道夫 并没有进入黄金森林</p>
<p begin="02:35:11.240" end="02:35:13.710">他已坠入黑暗深渊</p>
<p begin="02:35:18.380" end="02:35:22.880">他被烈焰和黑暗吞噬</p>
<p begin="02:35:24.550" end="02:35:28.250">魔苟斯的炎魔</p>
<p begin="02:35:28.990" end="02:35:32.360">我们不小心进入 摩瑞亚矿坑的陷阱</p>
<p begin="02:35:34.500" end="02:35:37.730">甘道夫做事一向都很小心</p>
<p begin="02:35:38.370" end="02:35:41.670">我们还不知道他的意图</p>
<p begin="02:35:46.410" end="02:35:50.740">别让凯萨督姆的毁灭 让你灰心丧志</p>
<p begin="02:35:50.910" end="02:35:53.250">金雳, 葛罗音之子</p>
<p begin="02:35:54.250" end="02:35:57.780">世上充满危险</p>
<p begin="02:35:59.260" end="02:36:01.920">到处都是困难重重</p>
<p begin="02:36:02.090" end="02:36:05.580">你们的心中充满悲伤</p>
<p begin="02:36:18.240" end="02:36:20.940">现在魔戒远征队会怎么样?</p>
<p begin="02:36:21.510" end="02:36:24.500">甘道夫死后就没有希望了</p>
<p begin="02:36:27.450" end="02:36:30.750">这趟旅程险象环生</p>
<p begin="02:36:30.920" end="02:36:34.010">你们只要一不小心就会失败</p>
<p begin="02:36:34.760" end="02:36:37.590">世界末日也会降临</p>
<p begin="02:36:41.930" end="02:36:47.770">只要你们团结一致就有希望</p>
<p begin="02:36:49.310" end="02:36:54.070">你们的信心不能动摇 快去休息吧</p>
<p begin="02:36:54.480" end="02:36:58.140">你们有太多的哀伤和疲惫</p>
<p begin="02:37:00.420" end="02:37:02.540">今晚你们要好好睡一觉…</p>
<p begin="02:37:02.820" end="02:37:06.260">欢迎, 夏尔的佛罗多</p>
<p begin="02:37:07.690" end="02:37:09.490">只有你见过邪眼</p>
<p begin="02:37:24.140" end="02:37:26.700">他们在为甘道夫哀悼</p>
<p begin="02:37:33.980" end="02:37:35.510">他们说些什么?</p>
<p begin="02:37:35.850" end="02:37:38.450">我不忍心告诉你们</p>
<p begin="02:37:41.360" end="02:37:43.590">我的伤痛尚未平息</p>
<p begin="02:37:46.560" end="02:37:49.400">他们一定没提到他放的烟火</p>
<p begin="02:37:49.570" end="02:37:52.590">他们应该作诗来歌颂这一点</p>
<p begin="02:37:56.070" end="02:37:58.060">从古到今最棒的烟火</p>
<p begin="02:37:59.180" end="02:38:02.010">在空中闪烁就像耀眼的星斗</p>
<p begin="02:38:02.950" end="02:38:08.150">这些闪闪发光的烟火 就像银河一样从天而降</p>
<p begin="02:38:08.850" end="02:38:11.650">就跟天空飘下的花雨一样缤纷</p>
<p begin="02:38:11.820" end="02:38:15.720">这都不足以形容它们有多壮观</p>
<p begin="02:38:26.500" end="02:38:29.200">快休息吧</p>
<p begin="02:38:29.410" end="02:38:32.070">这里很安全</p>
<p begin="02:38:32.280" end="02:38:34.800">我在这里无法休息</p>
<p begin="02:38:37.650" end="02:38:40.640">我听到她的声音</p>
<p begin="02:38:40.980" end="02:38:44.610">她提到我父亲和刚铎的灭亡</p>
<p begin="02:38:44.820" end="02:38:50.280">她说现在仍有一线希望</p>
<p begin="02:38:51.660" end="02:38:54.490">但是我却看不到</p>
<p begin="02:38:55.830" end="02:38:58.320">我们长久以来都没有希望</p>
<p begin="02:39:08.510" end="02:39:10.640">我父亲拥有高贵情操</p>
<p begin="02:39:11.450" end="02:39:13.640">但是他无法统治刚铎</p>
<p begin="02:39:16.790" end="02:39:19.380">人民也失去信心</p>
<p begin="02:39:20.820" end="02:39:24.350">他希望我能成功, 我也希望</p>
<p begin="02:39:24.530" end="02:39:28.050">我想要重建刚铎的荣耀</p>
<p begin="02:39:30.900" end="02:39:33.890">你见过吗?</p>
<p begin="02:39:34.540" end="02:39:36.560">爱克西里昂的白塔</p>
<p begin="02:39:36.770" end="02:39:40.570">就像珍珠一般闪闪发亮</p>
<p begin="02:39:41.280" end="02:39:44.770">塔上的旗子随风飘扬</p>
<p begin="02:39:47.650" end="02:39:49.640">你有没有听过</p>
<p begin="02:39:49.820" end="02:39:53.720">银号角的召唤声?</p>
<p begin="02:39:54.360" end="02:39:57.590">我很久以前见过…</p>
<p begin="02:39:57.930" end="02:39:59.420">这白色城市</p>
<p begin="02:40:00.400" end="02:40:05.360">有一天, 我们将一起去那儿</p>
<p begin="02:40:06.340" end="02:40:09.240">到时候守卫将高喊</p>
<p begin="02:40:09.710" end="02:40:13.040">"刚铎之主回来了"</p>
<p begin="02:41:20.240" end="02:41:22.770">请你看着镜子</p>
<p begin="02:41:22.950" end="02:41:24.470">我会看到什么?</p>
<p begin="02:41:27.450" end="02:41:29.780">最聪明的智者也不知道</p>
<p begin="02:41:30.690" end="02:41:32.520">因为镜子</p>
<p begin="02:41:32.760" end="02:41:35.280">能显现各种事情</p>
<p begin="02:41:38.290" end="02:41:40.660">过去的事情</p>
<p begin="02:41:40.900" end="02:41:43.460">现在的事情</p>
<p begin="02:41:44.200" end="02:41:46.170">还有一些</p>
<p begin="02:41:49.770" end="02:41:53.110">尚未发生的事情</p>
<p begin="02:43:15.630" end="02:43:18.490">我知道你看到什么</p>
<p begin="02:43:20.900" end="02:43:23.390">它一样也在我心里呈现</p>
<p begin="02:43:25.170" end="02:43:29.200">如果你失败就会发生这些事</p>
<p begin="02:43:31.610" end="02:43:36.480">魔戒远征队已经开始四分五裂</p>
<p begin="02:43:37.110" end="02:43:40.410">他会试图抢走魔戒</p>
<p begin="02:43:40.620" end="02:43:42.610">你知道我说的是谁</p>
<p begin="02:43:43.620" end="02:43:48.280">他们会一个接一个被魔戒击垮</p>
<p begin="02:43:49.790" end="02:43:52.230">只要你开口</p>
<p begin="02:43:52.630" end="02:43:55.690">我就把至尊魔戒给你</p>
<p begin="02:43:56.730" end="02:43:58.930">你肯毫无条件地给我?</p>
<p begin="02:44:03.510" end="02:44:07.440">我承认我很想要魔戒</p>
<p begin="02:44:13.820" end="02:44:17.080">我将成为魔戒之后</p>
<p begin="02:44:17.550" end="02:44:21.350">她并不黑暗, 而是美丽 跟曙光一样耀眼</p>
<p begin="02:44:21.990" end="02:44:25.020">跟海洋一样高深莫测</p>
<p begin="02:44:25.530" end="02:44:30.470">远比土地更加坚强</p>
<p begin="02:44:30.900" end="02:44:33.270">世人都将迷恋我</p>
<p begin="02:44:33.500" end="02:44:36.340">而且自暴自弃 而且自暴自弃</p>
<p begin="02:44:50.420" end="02:44:54.750">我通过了试炼</p>
<p begin="02:44:55.030" end="02:44:57.490">我将退隐到西方</p>
<p begin="02:44:57.690" end="02:45:02.130">－继续当凯兰崔尔女王 －我一个人无法摧毁它</p>
<p begin="02:45:05.770" end="02:45:09.900">你是魔戒持有者, 佛罗多 持有至尊魔戒</p>
<p begin="02:45:10.810" end="02:45:12.300">就必须孤单一个人</p>
<p begin="02:45:15.750" end="02:45:18.510">这是南雅, 钻石魔戒</p>
<p begin="02:45:18.720" end="02:45:20.310">我是它的持有者</p>
<p begin="02:45:23.520" end="02:45:27.150">这是你的使命</p>
<p begin="02:45:28.190" end="02:45:31.060">如果你办不到</p>
<p begin="02:45:32.260" end="02:45:34.250">也没有人可以</p>
<p begin="02:45:34.670" end="02:45:37.830">我知道该怎么做了</p>
<p begin="02:45:38.500" end="02:45:39.700">只是…</p>
<p begin="02:45:42.940" end="02:45:45.200">我感到害怕</p>
<p begin="02:45:48.710" end="02:45:53.840">再渺小的人也能改变未来</p>
<p begin="02:45:59.190" end="02:46:04.920">你知道半兽人是怎么来的吗?</p>
<p begin="02:46:05.700" end="02:46:09.030">它们曾经是精灵</p>
<p begin="02:46:10.200" end="02:46:13.530">但是却被黑暗力量</p>
<p begin="02:46:13.740" end="02:46:16.900">折磨到不成人形</p>
<p begin="02:46:17.240" end="02:46:22.540">它们是被扭曲的可怕生物</p>
<p begin="02:46:22.810" end="02:46:24.680">却在我手中</p>
<p begin="02:46:26.120" end="02:46:27.980">达到完美境界</p>
<p begin="02:46:28.720" end="02:46:31.880">我的强兽人战士</p>
<p begin="02:46:33.820" end="02:46:36.160">你的主人是谁?</p>
<p begin="02:46:36.330" end="02:46:38.820">萨鲁曼</p>
<p begin="02:46:59.720" end="02:47:03.120">猎杀他们 找不到他们绝不罢手</p>
<p begin="02:47:03.320" end="02:47:06.260">你们没有痛苦也没有恐惧</p>
<p begin="02:47:06.460" end="02:47:09.430">你们只会杀人</p>
<p begin="02:47:14.460" end="02:47:18.160">有一个半身人手中有宝物</p>
<p begin="02:47:18.340" end="02:47:22.530">我要你毫发无伤地活抓他</p>
<p begin="02:47:24.340" end="02:47:25.640">杀了其他的人</p>
<p begin="02:47:44.830" end="02:47:50.290">我们从来没有让外人 穿上我们精灵的衣服</p>
<p begin="02:47:51.340" end="02:47:55.140">希望这些精灵斗篷 能让你们躲过敌人的侦察</p>
<p begin="02:48:02.350" end="02:48:03.970">这是兰巴斯</p>
<p begin="02:48:04.210" end="02:48:05.810">精灵的干粮</p>
<p begin="02:48:08.320" end="02:48:11.310">只要咬一小口 就能让一个成年人填饱肚子</p>
<p begin="02:48:17.790" end="02:48:19.760">你吃了几块?</p>
<p begin="02:48:19.930" end="02:48:21.590">四块</p>
<p begin="02:48:27.370" end="02:48:30.000">你们每向南方走一步 就离危险更接近一步</p>
<p begin="02:48:30.170" end="02:48:34.300">魔多的半兽人 占领了安都因河东岸</p>
<p begin="02:48:34.480" end="02:48:36.970">但是西岸也并不安全</p>
<p begin="02:48:37.180" end="02:48:41.010">萨鲁曼的白掌部队 曾经出没在我们的边界</p>
<p begin="02:48:41.180" end="02:48:46.280">半兽人不能在大太阳下行动 但是这些怪物却可以</p>
<p begin="02:48:54.970" end="02:48:57.530">他们在追杀你们</p>
<p begin="02:48:58.970" end="02:49:03.570">只有走水路才有可能 赶在敌人前面到达拉洛斯瀑布</p>
<p begin="02:49:20.890" end="02:49:25.690">勒苟拉斯, 我送你的礼物 是凯兰崔姆弓箭</p>
<p begin="02:49:25.860" end="02:49:29.350">能让你拥有百步穿杨的绝技</p>
<p begin="02:49:34.740" end="02:49:37.210">这些是诺多伦短剑</p>
<p begin="02:49:37.370" end="02:49:41.370">曾经在战场上杀敌无数</p>
<p begin="02:49:41.550" end="02:49:43.840">千万别害怕, 小彼利坚.图克</p>
<p begin="02:49:44.010" end="02:49:47.310">你会找到你的勇气</p>
<p begin="02:49:49.190" end="02:49:51.180">还有你, 山姆卫斯詹吉</p>
<p begin="02:49:51.350" end="02:49:53.880">我送你十一条 希斯蓝制作的绳子</p>
<p begin="02:49:54.220" end="02:49:56.350">谢谢你, 女王</p>
<p begin="02:49:58.200" end="02:50:01.530">这些漂亮的短剑都用完了吗?</p>
<p begin="02:50:07.940" end="02:50:10.960">矮人要向精灵要什么礼物?</p>
<p begin="02:50:11.140" end="02:50:13.270">什么都不要</p>
<p begin="02:50:13.910" end="02:50:17.240">我只想再看凯兰崔姆女王 最后一眼就已足够了</p>
<p begin="02:50:17.880" end="02:50:23.080">因为她比地底蕴藏的 所有的珠宝都更加美丽</p>
<p begin="02:50:30.130" end="02:50:31.720">不过呢</p>
<p begin="02:50:31.900" end="02:50:33.520">我是有一个要求</p>
<p begin="02:50:34.330" end="02:50:36.990">不过我不敢奢想 这是不可能实现的愿望</p>
<p begin="02:50:37.170" end="02:50:39.970">我也不该开口</p>
<p begin="02:50:42.540" end="02:50:44.630">我不能再给你什么</p>
<p begin="02:50:44.810" end="02:50:48.400">因为你已拥有最珍贵的礼物</p>
<p begin="02:50:49.510" end="02:50:50.540">那就是亚玟的爱</p>
<p begin="02:50:51.850" end="02:50:57.180">但是我怕亚玟会越来越虚弱</p>
<p begin="02:50:57.950" end="02:51:01.290">所以我要让她离开中土世界</p>
<p begin="02:51:02.830" end="02:51:05.730">跟其他的精灵在一起</p>
<p begin="02:51:07.730" end="02:51:13.470">我会要她坐船到瓦林诺</p>
<p begin="02:51:13.740" end="02:51:16.800">她必须面对这个抉择</p>
<p begin="02:51:17.540" end="02:51:20.440">你也必须做出决定, 亚拉冈</p>
<p begin="02:51:20.740" end="02:51:26.580">重建自伊兰迪尔以后 你的先祖创造的辉煌成就</p>
<p begin="02:51:26.750" end="02:51:31.080">或是带着你仅存的子民 坠入绝望的黑暗深渊</p>
<p begin="02:51:38.360" end="02:51:39.660">再会了</p>
<p begin="02:51:43.530" end="02:51:46.900">你尚未完全发挥你的潜力</p>
<p begin="02:51:53.410" end="02:51:54.710">但是我们将不会再见面</p>
<p begin="02:51:54.880" end="02:51:56.240">伊力萨</p>
<p begin="02:51:58.680" end="02:52:01.880">再见了, 佛罗多巴金斯</p>
<p begin="02:52:02.050" end="02:52:05.490">我将埃兰迪尔之光送给你</p>
<p begin="02:52:06.320" end="02:52:08.660">这是我们最挚爱的星辰</p>
<p begin="02:52:17.800" end="02:52:22.200">愿它在所有光亮熄灭时</p>
<p begin="02:52:22.410" end="02:52:26.540">在黑暗中为你照亮光明</p>
<p begin="02:52:35.420" end="02:52:38.580">这种离别是最感伤的</p>
<p begin="02:52:39.220" end="02:52:43.520">因为这是我最后一次 看到世上最美丽的女王</p>
<p begin="02:52:44.260" end="02:52:47.590">从此以后除非是她的礼物 在我眼中没有什么是美丽的</p>
<p begin="02:52:47.830" end="02:52:49.800">她送你什么礼物?</p>
<p begin="02:52:49.970" end="02:52:54.900">我向她要一根她头上的头发</p>
<p begin="02:52:55.670" end="02:52:58.570">她给了我三根</p>
<p begin="02:54:40.740" end="02:54:44.180">那是咕鲁 他从摩瑞亚矿坑一直在跟踪我们</p>
<p begin="02:54:47.920" end="02:54:51.010">我以为在河上就能甩掉他</p>
<p begin="02:54:51.250" end="02:54:54.420">可惜他的水性很好</p>
<p begin="02:54:55.260" end="02:54:58.560">如果他把我们的行踪告诉敌人</p>
<p begin="02:54:58.730" end="02:55:00.960">我们想要渡河就会更危险</p>
<p begin="02:55:01.160" end="02:55:03.220">吃点东西吧, 佛罗多先生</p>
<p begin="02:55:03.400" end="02:55:06.460">－不要 －你一整天都没吃过东西</p>
<p begin="02:55:06.670" end="02:55:09.760">你也睡得很不安稳 别以为我没注意到</p>
<p begin="02:55:10.710" end="02:55:13.700">－佛罗多先生 －我很好</p>
<p begin="02:55:13.940" end="02:55:15.100">你并不好</p>
<p begin="02:55:15.410" end="02:55:17.900">我是来帮你的</p>
<p begin="02:55:18.080" end="02:55:19.780">我答应甘道夫我会守在你身边</p>
<p begin="02:55:25.760" end="02:55:28.490">你帮不了我, 山姆</p>
<p begin="02:55:30.630" end="02:55:32.390">这次不行</p>
<p begin="02:55:35.270" end="02:55:37.390">去睡吧</p>
<p begin="02:55:43.610" end="02:55:45.800">到米那斯提力斯比较安全</p>
<p begin="02:55:46.340" end="02:55:49.110">我们可以在那里养精蓄锐</p>
<p begin="02:55:49.780" end="02:55:52.010">然后一鼓作气攻向魔多</p>
<p begin="02:55:52.280" end="02:55:55.150">刚铎也帮不了我们</p>
<p begin="02:55:55.620" end="02:55:57.610">你倒是很愿意接受精灵的帮忙</p>
<p begin="02:55:59.490" end="02:56:02.320">你对你自己的人民 一点信心都没有吗?</p>
<p begin="02:56:02.490" end="02:56:05.480">他们的力量是很薄弱 意志也不够坚定</p>
<p begin="02:56:05.660" end="02:56:09.000">但是人类拥有无比的勇气 和高贵的情操</p>
<p begin="02:56:09.230" end="02:56:11.430">可是你都看不到</p>
<p begin="02:56:11.770" end="02:56:13.170">你很害怕</p>
<p begin="02:56:13.440" end="02:56:16.000">你这辈子都躲在阴影下</p>
<p begin="02:56:16.270" end="02:56:19.730">不敢承认你自己的身份</p>
<p begin="02:56:22.150" end="02:56:26.510">我不会把魔戒带到你的城市</p>
<p begin="02:56:38.360" end="02:56:39.690">佛罗多</p>
<p begin="02:56:41.560" end="02:56:43.050">亚苟那斯巨像</p>
<p begin="02:56:46.540" end="02:56:50.270">我一直都想仰望过往的国王</p>
<p begin="02:56:51.010" end="02:56:52.910">我的祖先</p>
<p begin="02:58:11.960" end="02:58:14.150">天一黑我们就渡湖</p>
<p begin="02:58:14.390" end="02:58:16.950">把船藏好再用走的</p>
<p begin="02:58:17.160" end="02:58:20.620">－从北边进入魔多 －是吗?</p>
<p begin="02:58:20.960" end="02:58:24.800">只要通过爱明莫尔就行了</p>
<p begin="02:58:24.970" end="02:58:28.230">那是充满尖石的迷宫</p>
<p begin="02:58:28.440" end="02:58:31.500">然后呢, 更精采了</p>
<p begin="02:58:31.940" end="02:58:36.840">那儿有一望无际的臭沼泽地</p>
<p begin="02:58:37.010" end="02:58:38.450">我们要走这条路</p>
<p begin="02:58:39.980" end="02:58:43.150">休息吧, 你要养精蓄锐</p>
<p begin="02:58:43.390" end="02:58:45.120">养精蓄锐个头</p>
<p begin="02:58:48.120" end="02:58:50.090">－最好马上启程 －不行</p>
<p begin="02:58:50.290" end="02:58:54.700">半兽人在巡逻东岸 我们一定要等到天黑再出发</p>
<p begin="02:58:54.930" end="02:58:58.390">我担心的不是东岸</p>
<p begin="02:58:58.600" end="02:59:02.590">我心中一直 有一个阴影和威胁</p>
<p begin="02:59:03.110" end="02:59:07.300">有什么正在接近, 我感觉得到</p>
<p begin="02:59:09.280" end="02:59:14.220">矮人族才不必养精蓄锐 别理他, 小哈比人</p>
<p begin="02:59:14.720" end="02:59:16.450">佛罗多呢?</p>
<p begin="02:59:42.080" end="02:59:44.010">我们都不该一个人乱跑</p>
<p begin="02:59:45.380" end="02:59:47.510">尤其是你</p>
<p begin="02:59:47.720" end="02:59:50.190">你的责任重大</p>
<p begin="02:59:51.220" end="02:59:53.190">佛罗多?</p>
<p begin="03:00:00.260" end="03:00:02.860">我知道你想一个人静静</p>
<p begin="03:00:03.570" end="03:00:07.000">我每天都看着你受苦</p>
<p begin="03:00:07.770" end="03:00:10.860">你确定你不是白白受苦吗?</p>
<p begin="03:00:12.510" end="03:00:15.170">有其它的路, 佛罗多</p>
<p begin="03:00:15.380" end="03:00:19.210">－我们可以走另一条路 －我知道你想说什么</p>
<p begin="03:00:19.420" end="03:00:23.220">好像很有道理, 但我得到警告</p>
<p begin="03:00:23.420" end="03:00:26.510">警告? 什么警告?</p>
<p begin="03:00:26.720" end="03:00:28.850">我们都很害怕</p>
<p begin="03:00:29.060" end="03:00:32.690">但如果让恐惧摧毁一切希望</p>
<p begin="03:00:32.900" end="03:00:36.700">－未免太不值得了吧? －没有别的路可走</p>
<p begin="03:00:38.430" end="03:00:41.770">我只想得到捍卫人民的力量</p>
<p begin="03:00:43.370" end="03:00:45.400">－只要你把魔戒借我 －不行</p>
<p begin="03:00:46.640" end="03:00:50.310">－别害怕, 我不是强盗 －你失去了理智</p>
<p begin="03:00:52.120" end="03:00:55.450">你以为你能成功吗?</p>
<p begin="03:00:55.650" end="03:01:00.320">他们会找到你, 把魔戒抢走</p>
<p begin="03:01:00.560" end="03:01:04.250">让你求生不能、求死不得</p>
<p begin="03:01:06.400" end="03:01:08.450">你这傻瓜</p>
<p begin="03:01:08.660" end="03:01:12.660">你只是靠运气得到它 它应该是我的</p>
<p begin="03:01:12.840" end="03:01:15.670">它应该是我的, 给我吧</p>
<p begin="03:01:15.840" end="03:01:17.140">－快给我 －不</p>
<p begin="03:01:17.310" end="03:01:19.140">－给我 －不</p>
<p begin="03:01:26.780" end="03:01:28.810">我知道了</p>
<p begin="03:01:29.050" end="03:01:31.990">你会把魔戒交给索伦</p>
<p begin="03:01:32.190" end="03:01:34.090">你会背叛我们</p>
<p begin="03:01:34.290" end="03:01:37.490">你会害我们跟你一起死</p>
<p begin="03:01:37.930" end="03:01:41.590">我诅咒你和所有的半身人</p>
<p begin="03:01:48.640" end="03:01:50.160">佛罗多?</p>
<p begin="03:01:54.480" end="03:01:56.070">佛罗多</p>
<p begin="03:01:59.980" end="03:02:02.010">我做了什么?</p>
<p begin="03:02:02.220" end="03:02:03.950">求求你, 佛罗多</p>
<p begin="03:02:04.150" end="03:02:06.820">佛罗多, 对不起</p>
<p begin="03:02:55.400" end="03:02:56.840">佛罗多?</p>
<p begin="03:02:58.070" end="03:03:01.170">－它蛊惑了波罗莫 －魔戒呢?</p>
<p begin="03:03:01.380" end="03:03:03.170">别过来</p>
<p begin="03:03:03.580" end="03:03:05.170">佛罗多</p>
<p begin="03:03:07.420" end="03:03:11.250">－我发誓要保护你 －你能保证不害我吗?</p>
<p begin="03:03:20.930" end="03:03:23.420">你会摧毁它吗?</p>
<p begin="03:03:28.400" end="03:03:30.370">亚拉冈</p>
<p begin="03:03:33.780" end="03:03:36.110">亚拉冈</p>
<p begin="03:03:37.910" end="03:03:39.780">伊力萨</p>
<p begin="03:03:47.420" end="03:03:50.790">我愿意跟随你到最后</p>
<p begin="03:03:51.460" end="03:03:54.290">跟随你到魔多烈焰</p>
<p begin="03:03:57.630" end="03:03:58.790">我明白了</p>
<p begin="03:04:01.270" end="03:04:06.730">好好照顾他们 尤其是山姆, 他不会了解</p>
<p begin="03:04:10.480" end="03:04:12.210">去吧, 佛罗多</p>
<p begin="03:04:15.220" end="03:04:16.710">快跑啊</p>
<p begin="03:04:16.950" end="03:04:18.610">快跑</p>
<p begin="03:04:43.180" end="03:04:44.840">佛罗多先生</p>
<p begin="03:04:54.120" end="03:04:55.890">去找半身人</p>
<p begin="03:04:57.530" end="03:05:00.050">快去找半身人</p>
<p begin="03:05:03.530" end="03:05:05.190">伊兰迪尔!</p>
<p begin="03:05:11.710" end="03:05:13.270">亚拉冈, 快走</p>
<p begin="03:05:35.000" end="03:05:36.290">佛罗多</p>

<p begin="03:05:39.100" end="03:05:40.570">快呀</p>
<p begin="03:05:43.040" end="03:05:45.060">他在干嘛?</p>
<p begin="03:05:49.310" end="03:05:51.300">他要离开了</p>
<p begin="03:05:56.090" end="03:05:59.020">－不! －皮聘!</p>
<p begin="03:06:03.930" end="03:06:06.260">快跑吧, 佛罗多</p>

<p begin="03:12:06.190" end="03:12:08.450">我没有想到</p>

<p begin="03:15:05.000" end="03:15:07.990">真希望这一切都没发生</p>
<p begin="03:15:10.970" end="03:15:13.770">每个人遇到难关都会这么想</p>
<p begin="03:15:13.940" end="03:15:17.430">但是我们无法决定自己的命运</p>
<p begin="03:15:17.610" end="03:15:20.240">你只能想…</p>
<p begin="03:15:20.450" end="03:15:25.180">该如何完成你被赋与的使命</p>
<p begin="03:15:54.020" end="03:15:56.110">不、不、不</p>

<p begin="03:18:12.350" end="03:18:16.920">快, 他们就快到东岸了</p>
<p begin="03:18:31.810" end="03:18:36.800">－你不打算跟去? －我们帮不了佛罗多了</p>
<p begin="03:18:40.220" end="03:18:45.120">我们一切的努力都白费了 远征队也彻底失败</p>
<p begin="03:18:56.970" end="03:19:00.130">我们的努力不会白费</p>
<p begin="03:19:01.500" end="03:19:05.960">我们不能丢下梅里和皮聘 让他们受苦</p>
<p begin="03:19:06.980" end="03:19:12.210">只要我们还有力气 把用不着的东西留下来</p>
<p begin="03:19:13.520" end="03:19:15.540">尽量减轻负担</p>

<p begin="03:19:55.220" end="03:19:57.660">也许还会再见</p>
<p begin="03:19:57.860" end="03:19:59.420">也许会</p>

<p begin="03:20:06.170" end="03:20:08.760">我很高兴有你陪着我</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.560" end="00:00:37.620">The world is changed.</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.800" end="00:00:40.830">I feel it in the water.</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.570" end="00:00:44.510">I feel it in the earth.</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.060" end="00:00:49.070">I smell it in the air.</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.430" end="00:00:51.380">Much that once was...</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.580" end="00:00:53.140">...is lost.</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.840" end="00:00:56.880">For none now live who remember it.</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.800" end="00:01:14.170">It began with the forging of the Great Rings.</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.370" end="00:01:16.270">Three were given to the Elves:</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.440" end="00:01:20.240">Immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings.</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.310" end="00:01:23.370">Seven to the Dwarf-lords:</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.110" end="00:01:28.550">Great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls.</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.020" end="00:01:30.250">And nine...</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.450" end="00:01:33.450">...nine rings were gifted to the race of Men...</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.690" end="00:01:37.520">...who, above all else, desire power.</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.630" end="00:01:43.860">For within these rings was bound the strength and will to govern each race.</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.370" end="00:01:48.530">But they were all of them deceived.</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.770" end="00:01:50.860">For another ring was made.</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.710" end="00:01:55.270">In the land of Mordor, in the fires of Mount Doom...</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.710" end="00:02:00.150">...the Dark Lord Sauron forged in secret a Master Ring...</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.380" end="00:02:02.410">...to control all others.</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.620" end="00:02:06.580">And into this Ring he poured his cruelty, his malice...</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.790" end="00:02:10.990">...and his will to dominate all life.</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.960" end="00:02:15.860">One Ring to rule them all.</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.670" end="00:02:18.360">One by one...</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.570" end="00:02:23.230">...the Free Lands of Middle-earth fell to the power of the Ring.</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.440" end="00:02:26.470">But there were some who resisted.</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.940" end="00:02:31.610">A Last Alliance of Men and Elves marched against the armies of Mordor.</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.810" end="00:02:36.440">And on the slopes of Mount Doom, they fought for the freedom of Middle-earth.</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.780" end="00:03:09.410">Victory was near.</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.160" end="00:03:15.920">But the power of the Ring...</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.730" end="00:03:18.160">...could not be undone.</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.750" end="00:03:44.690">It was in this moment...</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.890" end="00:03:47.250">...when all hope had faded...</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.490" end="00:03:51.590">...that Isildur, son of the king, took up his father's sword.</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.690" end="00:04:29.190">Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples of Middle-earth, was defeated.</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.070" end="00:04:38.230">The Ring passed to Isildur...</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.440" end="00:04:42.640">...who had this one chance to destroy evil forever.</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.380" end="00:04:45.510">But the hearts of Men...</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.720" end="00:04:48.210">...are easily corrupted.</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.450" end="00:04:53.080">And the Ring of Power has a will of its own.</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.280" end="00:05:20.910">It betrayed Isildur...</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.750" end="00:05:25.150">...to his death.</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.330" end="00:05:33.190">And some things that should not have been forgotten...</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.430" end="00:05:35.760">...were lost.</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.600" end="00:05:38.790">History became legend...</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.000" end="00:05:40.990">...legend became myth.</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.200" end="00:05:44.100">And for two and a half thousand years...</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.270" end="00:05:47.970">...the Ring passed out of all knowledge.</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.610" end="00:05:51.440">Until, when chance came...</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.110" end="00:05:55.210">...it ensnared a new bearer.</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.590" end="00:06:01.390">My precious.</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.660" end="00:06:04.180">The Ring came to the creature Gollum...</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.360" end="00:06:08.300">...who took it deep into the tunnels of the Misty Mountains.</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.600" end="00:06:11.460">And there it consumed him.</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.670" end="00:06:13.690">It came to me.</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.900" end="00:06:18.340">My own. My love. My own.</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.540" end="00:06:23.240">My precious.</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.880" end="00:06:30.320">The Ring brought to Gollum unnatural long life.</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.520" end="00:06:34.350">For 500 years it poisoned his mind.</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.560" end="00:06:39.150">And in the gloom of Gollum 's cave, it waited.</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.360" end="00:06:42.630">Darkness crept back into the forests of the world.</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.870" end="00:06:45.700">Rumor grew of a shadow in the East...</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.900" end="00:06:48.700">...whispers of a nameless fear.</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.900" end="00:06:52.200">And the Ring of Power perceived...</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.410" end="00:06:55.210">...its time had now come.</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.650" end="00:07:00.270">It abandoned Gollum.</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.950" end="00:07:05.440">But something happened then the Ring did not intend.</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.290" end="00:07:10.880">It was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable.</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.090" end="00:07:12.150">What's this?</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.360" end="00:07:13.790">A Hobbit.</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.960" end="00:07:16.730">Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.930" end="00:07:18.700">A ring.</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.900" end="00:07:20.770">Lost!</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.540" end="00:07:26.980">My precious is lost!</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.210" end="00:07:29.470">For the time will soon come...</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.750" end="00:07:34.910">...when Hobbits will shape the fortunes of all.</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.690" end="00:07:42.750">The 22nd day of September...</p>

<p begin="00:08:51.630" end="00:08:55.150">Hobbits have been living and farming in the four Farthings of the Shire...</p>

<p begin="00:08:57.500" end="00:09:00.470">...quite content to ignore and be ignored...</p>

<p begin="00:09:04.210" end="00:09:09.840">Middle-earth being, after all, full of strange creatures beyond count...</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.010" end="00:09:13.210">...Hobbits must seem of little importance...</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.380" end="00:09:17.410">...being neither renowned as great warriors...</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.590" end="00:09:21.780">...nor counted among the very wise.</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.160" end="00:09:29.150">Frodo! Someone at the door.</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.370" end="00:09:32.930">In fact, it has been remarked by some...</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.100" end="00:09:37.540">...that Hobbits' only real passion is for food.</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.910" end="00:09:40.100">A rather unfair observation...</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.310" end="00:09:43.940">...as we have also developed a keen interest in the brewing of ales...</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.380" end="00:09:47.110">...and the smoking of pipe-weed.</p>

<p begin="00:09:50.620" end="00:09:52.710">...is in peace and quiet...</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.420" end="00:09:55.620">...and good, tilled earth.</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.820" end="00:10:00.960">For all Hobbits share a love of things that grow.</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.130" end="00:10:08.540">And, yes, no doubt to others, our ways seem quaint.</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.700" end="00:10:13.940">But today of all days, it is brought home to me:</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.540" end="00:10:20.480">It is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life.</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.620" end="00:10:27.850">Frodo, the door!</p>

<p begin="00:11:15.040" end="00:11:18.840">A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins.</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.640" end="00:11:24.270">Nor is he early. He arrives precisely when he means to.</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.620" end="00:11:38.680">It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.560" end="00:11:46.300">You didn't think I'd miss your Uncle Bilbo's birthday?</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.000" end="00:11:50.130">How is the old rascal?</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.670" end="00:11:54.200">I hear it's going to be a party of special magnificence.</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.380" end="00:11:56.840">You know Bilbo. He's got the whole place in an uproar.</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.010" end="00:11:58.980">Well, that should please him.</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.150" end="00:12:01.010">Half the Shire's been invited.</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.250" end="00:12:03.880">And the rest of them are turning up anyway.</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.060" end="00:12:10.390">And so life in the Shire goes on...</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.560" end="00:12:13.590">...very much as it has this past Age...</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.760" end="00:12:19.330">...full of its own comings and goings, with change coming slowly.</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.500" end="00:12:21.400">If it comes at all.</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.670" end="00:12:26.110">For things are made to endure in the Shire...</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.280" end="00:12:29.770">...passing from one generation to the next.</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.210" end="00:12:35.170">There 's always been a Baggins living here under the Hill...</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.380" end="00:12:36.720">...in Bag End.</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.490" end="00:12:42.250">And there always will be.</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.990" end="00:12:46.390">To tell you the truth, Bilbo's been a bit odd lately.</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.630" end="00:12:49.860">I mean, more than usual.</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.900" end="00:12:52.760">He's taken to locking himself in his study.</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.370" end="00:12:58.530">He spends hours poring over old maps when he thinks I'm not looking.</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.250" end="00:13:12.910">Where's it gone?</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.580" end="00:13:41.810">He's up to something.</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.960" end="00:13:52.450">- All right, then. Keep your secrets. - What?</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.660" end="00:13:54.360">But I know you have something to do with it.</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.630" end="00:13:55.650">Good gracious me.</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.130" end="00:13:58.860">Before you came along, we Bagginses were very well thought of.</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.130" end="00:13:59.960">Indeed.</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.300" end="00:14:02.500">Never had any adventures or did anything unexpected.</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.110" end="00:14:08.980">If you're referring to the incident with the dragon, I was barely involved.</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.180" end="00:14:12.770">All I did was give your uncle a little nudge out of the door.</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.950" end="00:14:17.080">Whatever you did, you've been officially labeled a disturber of the peace.</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.450" end="00:14:19.320">Oh, really?</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.030" end="00:14:26.960">Gandalf! Gandalf!</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.140" end="00:14:34.330">Fireworks, Gandalf!</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.410" end="00:14:40.030">- Gandalf! - Fireworks, Gandalf!</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.890" end="00:14:59.920">Gandalf?</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.530" end="00:15:04.630">- I'm glad you're back. - So am I, dear boy.</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.040" end="00:15:10.870">So am I.</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.700" end="00:15:44.140">No, thank you!</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.310" end="00:15:48.270">We don't want any more visitors, well-wishers or distant relations!</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.480" end="00:15:51.970">And what about very old friends?</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.180" end="00:15:56.880">Gandalf?</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.490" end="00:16:00.980">- Bilbo Baggins. - My dear Gandalf!</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.220" end="00:16:06.320">Good to see you. 111 years old! Who would believe it?</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.100" end="00:16:10.090">You haven't aged a day.</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.770" end="00:16:18.740">Come on, come in!</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.940" end="00:16:21.310">Welcome, welcome.</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.480" end="00:16:25.000">Oh, here we are.</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.720" end="00:16:29.150">Tea? Or maybe something a little stronger?</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.320" end="00:16:33.120">I've got a few bottles of the Old Winyard left. 1296.</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.320" end="00:16:37.350">Very good year. Almost as old as I am.</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.530" end="00:16:43.020">It was laid down by my father. What say we open one, eh?</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.230" end="00:16:45.860">Just tea, thank you.</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.310" end="00:16:53.930">I was expecting you sometime last week.</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.140" end="00:16:57.440">Not that it matters. You come and go as you please. Always have and always will.</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.650" end="00:17:02.880">You caught me a bit unprepared. We've only got cold chicken and a bit of pickle....</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.050" end="00:17:06.450">There's some cheese here. No, that won't do.</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.660" end="00:17:10.560">We've got raspberry jam, an apple tart....</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.260" end="00:17:15.250">But not much for afters. Oh, no, we're all right.</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.460" end="00:17:18.300">I've just found some sponge cake.</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.170" end="00:17:22.500">I could make you some eggs if you'd--</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.340" end="00:17:29.000">- Just tea, thank you. - Oh, right.</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.080" end="00:17:32.410">- You don't mind if I eat, do you? - No, not at all.</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.520" end="00:17:35.380">Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.580" end="00:17:37.180">I'm not at home!</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.190" end="00:17:45.790">It's the Sackville-Bagginses.</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.990" end="00:17:48.050">- I know you're in there! - They're after the house.</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.730" end="00:17:51.220">They've never forgiven me for living this long.</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.430" end="00:17:54.230">I've got to get away from these confounded relatives, hanging on the bell all day...</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.400" end="00:17:56.370">...never giving me a moment's peace.</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.070" end="00:18:00.600">I want to see mountains again. Mountains, Gandalf!</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.810" end="00:18:05.370">And then find somewhere quiet where I can finish my book. Oh, tea.</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.550" end="00:18:09.510">- So you mean to go through with your plan? - Yes, yes. It's all in hand.</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.680" end="00:18:11.910">All the arrangements are made.</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.060" end="00:18:15.520">Oh, thank you.</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.220" end="00:18:18.390">Frodo suspects something.</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.560" end="00:18:21.030">Of course he does. He's a Baggins...</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.230" end="00:18:23.860">...not some blockheaded Bracegirdle from Hardbottle.</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.370" end="00:18:27.200">You will tell him, won't you?</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.070" end="00:18:30.100">- Yes, yes. - He's very fond of you.</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.340" end="00:18:33.860">I know.</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.140" end="00:18:39.580">He'd probably come with me if I asked him.</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.220" end="00:18:43.620">I think in his heart, Frodo's still in love with the Shire.</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.150" end="00:18:47.550">The woods, the fields.</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.720" end="00:18:50.050">Little rivers.</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.500" end="00:18:57.230">I am old, Gandalf.</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.570" end="00:19:03.870">I know I don't look it, but I'm beginning to feel it in my heart.</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.010" end="00:19:08.570">I feel thin.</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.740" end="00:19:10.440">Sort of stretched...</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.750" end="00:19:15.080">...like butter scraped over too much bread.</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.250" end="00:19:19.740">I need a holiday. A very long holiday.</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.960" end="00:19:23.150">And I don't expect I shall return.</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.390" end="00:19:28.590">In fact, I mean not to.</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.270" end="00:19:35.330">Old Toby. The finest weed in the Southfarthing.</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.690" end="00:19:55.280">Gandalf, my old friend...</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.460" end="00:19:58.290">...this will be a night to remember.</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.080" end="00:20:22.170">Hello, hello.</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.450" end="00:20:26.480">Fatty Bolger. Lovely to see you. Welcome, welcome.</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.520" end="00:20:30.050">Go on, Sam. Ask Rosie for a dance.</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.690" end="00:20:36.220">- I think I'll just have another ale. - Oh, no, you don't.</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.270" end="00:20:39.060">Go on!</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.210" end="00:20:51.040">So there I was...</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.250" end="00:20:55.340">...at the mercy of three monstrous trolls.</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.520" end="00:20:57.510">And they were all arguing amongst themselves...</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.720" end="00:21:00.090">...about how they were going to cook us.</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.290" end="00:21:05.350">Whether it be turned on a spit, or to sit on us one by one, squash us into jelly.</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.360" end="00:21:09.890">They spent so much time arguing the whithertos and the whyfors...</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.100" end="00:21:13.690">...that the sun's first light crept over the top of the trees...</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.700" end="00:21:17.190">...and turned them all to stone!</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.440" end="00:21:23.880">Quickly.</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.050" end="00:21:30.070">Up they go!</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.950" end="00:21:34.150">No, the big one.</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.330" end="00:21:46.230">Mrs. Bracegirdle, how nice to see you. Welcome, welcome.</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.400" end="00:21:48.300">Are all these children yours?</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.470" end="00:21:51.460">Good gracious, you have been productive.</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.480" end="00:21:54.810">Bilbo?</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.540" end="00:21:58.270">Sackville-Bagginses!</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.450" end="00:21:59.540">Quickly, hide!</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.360" end="00:22:11.620">Thank you, my boy.</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.130" end="00:22:15.460">You're a good lad, Frodo.</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.670" end="00:22:19.570">I'm very selfish, you know.</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.970" end="00:22:23.460">Yes, I am. Very selfish.</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.810" end="00:22:26.040">I don't know why I took you in after your mother and father died...</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.210" end="00:22:27.640">...but it wasn't out of charity.</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.280" end="00:22:29.680">I think it was because...</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.840" end="00:22:32.180">...of all my numerous relations...</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.480" end="00:22:35.970">...you were the one Baggins that showed real spirit.</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.280" end="00:22:38.080">Bilbo, have you been at the Gaffer's home brew?</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.320" end="00:22:39.980">No.</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.290" end="00:22:42.880">Well, yes, but that's not the point.</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.090" end="00:22:46.360">The point is, Frodo...</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.400" end="00:22:51.460">...you'll be all right.</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.840" end="00:22:56.900">- Done! - You're supposed to stick it in the ground.</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.110" end="00:22:58.570">- It is in the ground. - Outside!</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.740" end="00:23:00.300">This was your idea.</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.160" end="00:23:17.680">Bilbo.</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.830" end="00:23:21.630">Bilbo, watch out for the dragon!</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.830" end="00:23:25.200">Nonsense. There hasn't been a dragon in these parts for a thousand years.</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.680" end="00:23:42.280">- That was good. - Let's get another one.</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.590" end="00:23:48.110">Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took.</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.290" end="00:23:50.190">I might've known.</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.060" end="00:23:58.160">Speech, Bilbo!</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.030" end="00:24:00.360">Speech!</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.540" end="00:24:01.560">Speech!</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.810" end="00:24:09.070">My dear Bagginses and Boffins...</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.880" end="00:24:12.070">...Tooks and Brandybucks...</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.250" end="00:24:14.740">...Grubbs, Chubbs...</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.950" end="00:24:15.970">...Hornblowers...</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.190" end="00:24:18.810">...Bolgers...</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.220" end="00:24:20.740">...Bracegirdles...</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.960" end="00:24:23.580">- ...and Proudfoots. - Proudfeet!</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.760" end="00:24:28.920">Today is my 111th birthday!</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.730" end="00:24:32.260">Happy birthday!</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.470" end="00:24:36.770">But alas, eleventy-one years is far too short a time to live among...</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.940" end="00:24:39.840">...such excellent and admirable Hobbits.</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.780" end="00:24:43.510">I don't know half of you half as well as I should like...</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.750" end="00:24:48.310">...and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve.</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.290" end="00:25:00.660">I have things to do.</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.040" end="00:25:09.160">I've put this off far too long.</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.010" end="00:25:16.970">I regret to announce this is the end!</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.150" end="00:25:19.310">I'm going now.</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.450" end="00:25:23.320">I bid you all a very fond farewell.</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.690" end="00:25:26.880">Goodbye.</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.150" end="00:26:03.280">I suppose you think that was terribly clever.</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.490" end="00:26:06.860">Come on, Gandalf. Did you see their faces?</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.030" end="00:26:12.060">There are many magic rings in this world, and none of them should be used lightly.</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.300" end="00:26:14.430">It was just a bit of fun.</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.670" end="00:26:18.370">Oh, you're probably right, as usual.</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.740" end="00:26:23.300">- You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you? - Two eyes.</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.510" end="00:26:26.170">As often as I can spare them.</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.380" end="00:26:29.540">- I'm leaving everything to him. - What about this ring of yours?</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.750" end="00:26:33.080">- Is that staying too? - Yes, yes.</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.720" end="00:26:37.590">It's in an envelope over there on the mantelpiece.</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.690" end="00:26:41.630">No. Wait, it's...</p>

<p begin="00:27:12.790" end="00:27:14.350">And yes.</p>

<p begin="00:27:42.160" end="00:27:44.920">I think you've had that ring quite long enough.</p>

<p begin="00:39:42.810" end="00:39:47.140">We put it away. We keep it hidden. We never speak of it again.</p>

<p begin="00:40:50.780" end="00:40:54.410">...I would use this Ring from a desire to do good.</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.820" end="00:41:05.550">But through me, it would wield a power too great and terrible to imagine.</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.130" end="00:41:09.060">- But it cannot stay in the Shire! - No.</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.930" end="00:41:12.560">No, it can't.</p>

<p begin="00:41:24.710" end="00:41:27.940">Get out of the Shire. Make for the village of Bree.</p>

<p begin="00:41:42.600" end="00:41:48.130">I must see the head of my order. He is both wise and powerful. Trust me, Frodo.</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.340" end="00:41:50.460">He'll know what to do.</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.100" end="00:41:53.940">You'll have to leave the name of Baggins behind you.</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.140" end="00:41:56.630">That name is not safe outside the Shire.</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.310" end="00:42:00.610">Travel only by day. And stay off the road.</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.280" end="00:42:04.440">I can cut across country easily enough.</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.950" end="00:42:08.290">My dear Frodo.</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.560" end="00:42:11.620">Hobbits really are amazing creatures.</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.790" end="00:42:14.690">You can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a month.</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.900" end="00:42:17.300">And yet, after a hundred years...</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.460" end="00:42:19.490">...they can still surprise you.</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.130" end="00:42:22.470">Get down.</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.680" end="00:42:38.170">Confound it all, Samwise Gamgee! Have you been eavesdropping?</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.350" end="00:42:42.850">I haven't been dropping no eaves. Honest. I was cutting the grass under the window.</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.020" end="00:42:45.490">A little late for trimming the verge, don't you think?</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.660" end="00:42:48.530">- I heard raised voices. - What did you hear? Speak!</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.700" end="00:42:49.820">Nothing important.</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.360" end="00:42:54.490">That is, I heard a good deal about a ring, a Dark Lord and the end of the world but--</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.670" end="00:42:59.400">Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don't hurt me. Don't turn me into anything unnatural.</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.110" end="00:43:01.730">No?</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.940" end="00:43:04.070">Perhaps not.</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.350" end="00:43:08.750">I've thought of a better use for you.</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.520" end="00:43:13.510">Come along, Samwise. Keep up.</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.020" end="00:43:17.220">Be careful, both of you.</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.520" end="00:43:20.250">The enemy has many spies in his service:</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.530" end="00:43:23.430">Birds, beasts.</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.200" end="00:43:27.030">Is it safe?</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.700" end="00:43:30.070">Never put it on...</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.270" end="00:43:33.710">...for the agents of the Dark Lord will be drawn to its power.</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.870" end="00:43:35.360">Always remember, Frodo...</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.880" end="00:43:39.040">...the Ring is trying to get back to its master.</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.410" end="00:43:41.540">It wants to be found.</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.120" end="00:44:24.320">This is it.</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.660" end="00:44:26.790">This is what?</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.130" end="00:44:29.190">If I take one more step...</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.700" end="00:44:33.600">...it'll be the farthest away from home I've ever been.</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.800" end="00:44:39.290">Come on, Sam.</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.780" end="00:44:49.610">Remember what Bilbo used to say:</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.150" end="00:44:53.950">- "It's a dangerous business, Frodo." - "Going out your door.</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.120" end="00:44:58.560">You step onto the road, and if you don't keep your feet...</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.730" end="00:45:02.920">...there's no knowing where you might be swept off to. "</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.740" end="00:45:18.570">Sam.</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.050" end="00:45:23.180">Wood-elves.</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.900" end="00:45:40.460">They're going to the harbor beyond the White Towers.</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.000" end="00:45:42.730">To the Grey Havens.</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.340" end="00:45:45.360">They're leaving Middle-earth.</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.540" end="00:45:47.730">Never to return.</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.680" end="00:45:52.740">I don't know why...</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.480" end="00:45:55.850">...it makes me sad.</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.880" end="00:46:02.550">Everywhere I lie there's a dirty great root sticking into my back.</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.260" end="00:46:05.020">Just shut your eyes...</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.190" end="00:46:07.960">...and imagine you're back in your own bed...</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.130" end="00:46:12.060">...with a soft mattress and a lovely feather pillow.</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.370" end="00:46:24.070">It's not working, Mr. Frodo.</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.240" end="00:46:27.110">I'm never going to be able to sleep out here.</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.450" end="00:46:31.820">Me neither, Sam.</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.310" end="00:47:03.410">Smoke rises from the Mountain of Doom.</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.580" end="00:47:05.240">The hour grows late.</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.420" end="00:47:08.980">And Gandalf the Grey rides to Isengard...</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.190" end="00:47:11.620">...seeking my counsel.</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.830" end="00:47:15.820">For that is why you have come, is it not?</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.000" end="00:47:17.290">My old friend.</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.600" end="00:47:19.160">Saruman.</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.970" end="00:47:26.960">- You are sure of this? - Beyond any doubt.</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.810" end="00:47:30.110">So the Ring of Power has been found.</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.280" end="00:47:33.470">All these long years, it was in the Shire.</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.680" end="00:47:36.880">- Under my very nose. - Yet you did not have the wit to see it.</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.480" end="00:47:41.890">Your love of the halfling's leaf has clearly slowed your mind.</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.620" end="00:47:46.820">But we still have time. Time enough to counter Sauron if we act quickly.</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.990" end="00:47:48.480">Time?</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.460" end="00:47:52.090">What time do you think we have?</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.500" end="00:47:56.370">Sauron has regained much of his former strength.</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.540" end="00:47:58.800">He cannot yet take physical form...</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.970" end="00:48:01.670">...but his spirit has lost none of its potency.</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.340" end="00:48:07.410">Concealed within his fortress, the Lord of Mordor sees all.</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.980" end="00:48:13.920">His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth and flesh.</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.420" end="00:48:18.550">You know of what I speak, Gandalf.</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.490" end="00:48:24.730">A Great Eye, lidless, wreathed in flame.</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.700" end="00:48:27.500">The Eye of Sauron.</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.700" end="00:48:30.260">He is gathering all evil to him.</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.700" end="00:48:32.500">Very soon, he'll have summoned an army...</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.670" end="00:48:35.570">...great enough for an assault upon Middle-earth.</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.910" end="00:48:38.280">You know this?</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.850" end="00:48:40.340">How?</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.910" end="00:48:42.580">I have seen it.</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.020" end="00:48:46.210">A palantir is a dangerous tool, Saruman.</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.920" end="00:48:48.410">Why?</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.890" end="00:48:51.590">Why should we fear to use it?</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.230" end="00:48:58.220">They are not all accounted for, the lost Seeing-stones.</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.400" end="00:49:01.600">We do not know who else may be watching.</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.200" end="00:49:06.930">The hour is later than you think.</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.110" end="00:49:09.440">Sauron's forces are already moving.</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.710" end="00:49:14.440">The Nine have left Minas Morgul.</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.810" end="00:49:15.870">The Nine?</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.050" end="00:49:19.110">They crossed the River Isen on Midsummer's Eve...</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.290" end="00:49:21.950">...disguised as riders in black.</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.190" end="00:49:26.120">- They've reached the Shire? - They will find the Ring.</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.760" end="00:49:29.960">And kill the one who carries it.</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.460" end="00:49:31.950">Frodo!</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.580" end="00:49:48.980">You did not seriously think that a Hobbit could contend with the will of Sauron?</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.750" end="00:49:52.510">There are none who can.</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.020" end="00:49:57.790">Against the power of Mordor...</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.960" end="00:50:00.590">...there can be no victory.</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.530" end="00:50:05.730">We must join with him, Gandalf.</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.000" end="00:50:09.330">We must join with Sauron.</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.010" end="00:50:14.670">It would be wise, my friend.</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.140" end="00:50:16.630">Tell me...</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.810" end="00:50:17.830">...friend...</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.850" end="00:50:23.370">...when did Saruman the Wise abandon reason for madness?</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.890" end="00:51:04.580">I gave you the chance...</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.730" end="00:51:08.390">...of aiding me willingly...</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.560" end="00:51:12.730">...but you have elected the way of pain!</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.060" end="00:51:37.550">Mr. Frodo?</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.120" end="00:51:39.920">Frodo? Frodo!</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.360" end="00:51:44.590">- I thought I'd lost you. - What are you talking about?</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.760" end="00:51:47.760">- It's just something Gandalf said. - What did he say?</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.600" end="00:51:52.470">"Don't you lose him, Samwise Gamgee." And I don't mean to.</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.740" end="00:51:56.370">Sam, we're still in the Shire. What could possibly happen?</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.350" end="00:52:00.370">Frodo.</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.610" end="00:52:02.880">- Merry, it's Frodo Baggins. - Hello, Frodo.</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.080" end="00:52:04.450">Get off him.</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.950" end="00:52:06.440">Come on, Frodo.</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.620" end="00:52:08.480">What's the meaning of this?</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.960" end="00:52:12.050">You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.230" end="00:52:15.350">You get back here!</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.360" end="00:52:17.660">Get out of my field!</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.860" end="00:52:20.660">You'll know the devil if I catch up with you!</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.900" end="00:52:23.840">I don't know why he's so upset. It's only a couple of carrots.</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.000" end="00:52:25.130">And some cabbages.</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.310" end="00:52:28.270">And those three bags of potatoes that we lifted last week.</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.440" end="00:52:32.470">- And then the mushrooms the week before. - Yes, Pippin. My point is...</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.680" end="00:52:34.870">...he's clearly overreacting.</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.080" end="00:52:36.570">Run!</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.030" end="00:52:52.590">Oh, that was close.</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.670" end="00:52:56.790">I think I've broken something.</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.800" end="00:53:00.170">Trust a Brandybuck and a Took!</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.340" end="00:53:04.000">What? That was just a detour. A short cut.</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.180" end="00:53:06.440">- Short cut to what? - Mushrooms!</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.190" end="00:53:16.680">That's mine.</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.460" end="00:53:21.050">That's nice, Merry.</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.630" end="00:53:23.650">Here's a nice one, Sam.</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.830" end="00:53:26.360">I think we should get off the road.</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.540" end="00:53:36.940">Get off the road!</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.140" end="00:53:38.630">Quick!</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.320" end="00:53:52.810">Be quiet!</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.130" end="00:55:01.290">What was that?</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.990" end="00:55:35.480">Anything?</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.160" end="00:55:37.650">Nothing.</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.360" end="00:55:40.660">What is going on?</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.200" end="00:55:45.000">That Black Rider was looking for something. Or someone.</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.340" end="00:55:47.830">Frodo?</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.510" end="00:55:49.570">Get down!</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.490" end="00:56:08.690">I have to leave the Shire.</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.700" end="00:56:12.030">Sam and I must get to Bree.</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.200" end="00:56:13.670">Right.</p>

<p begin="00:56:33.720" end="00:56:34.740">Run!</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.070" end="00:56:49.830">Get the rope, Sam!</p>

<p begin="00:56:54.710" end="00:56:56.140">Run, Frodo!</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.440" end="00:56:57.570">- Go! - Hurry!</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.740" end="00:57:00.370">Frodo, come on!</p>

<p begin="00:57:18.260" end="00:57:22.460">- How far to the nearest crossing? - The Brandywine Bridge. 20 miles.</p>

<p begin="00:57:56.700" end="00:57:59.570">Hobbits. Four Hobbits!</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.740" end="00:58:03.700">What's more, out of the Shire by your talk. What business brings you to Bree?</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.210" end="00:58:07.270">We wish to stay at the inn. Our business is our own.</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.450" end="00:58:10.970">All right, young sir. I meant no offense.</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.150" end="00:58:13.680">It's my job to ask questions after nightfall.</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.850" end="00:58:16.750">There's talk of strange folk abroad.</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.920" end="00:58:19.080">Can't be too careful.</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.780" end="00:58:42.270">Out of the way! Watch where you're walking.</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.310" end="00:59:07.900">Excuse me.</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.980" end="00:59:11.740">Good evening, little masters. What can I do for you?</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.910" end="00:59:18.010">If you're seeking accommodation, we got some cozy Hobbit-sized rooms available.</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.220" end="00:59:22.880">Always proud to cater to the Little Folk, Mister...?</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.990" end="00:59:26.020">Underhill. My name's Underhill.</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.290" end="00:59:29.820">- Underhill, yes. - We're friends of Gandalf the Grey.</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.000" end="00:59:33.160">- Can you tell him we've arrived? - Gandalf?</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.570" end="00:59:35.330">Gandalf.</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.100" end="00:59:37.830">Oh, yes...</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.040" end="00:59:40.100">...I remember. Elderly chap.</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.440" end="00:59:43.410">Big grey beard, pointy hat.</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.810" end="00:59:45.610">Not seen him for six months.</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.420" end="00:59:53.720">What do we do now?</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.930" end="01:00:02.190">Sam...</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.360" end="01:00:04.230">...he'll be here. He'll come.</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.970" end="01:00:09.060">Get out of my way!</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.440" end="01:00:13.100">What's that?</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.340" end="01:00:15.860">This, my friend, is a pint.</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.040" end="01:00:17.630">It comes in pints?</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.040" end="01:00:21.740">- I'm getting one. - You got a whole half already!</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.090" end="01:00:31.920">That fellow's done nothing but stare at you since we arrived.</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.460" end="01:00:36.950">Excuse me.</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.760" end="01:00:41.760">That Man in the corner. Who is he?</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.940" end="01:00:47.300">He's one of them Rangers. They're dangerous folk, wandering the Wilds.</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.610" end="01:00:52.100">What his right name is, I've never heard, but around here he's known as Strider.</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.480" end="01:00:55.670">Strider.</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.760" end="01:01:11.960">Baggins.</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.430" end="01:01:16.960">Baggins.</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.320" end="01:01:31.550">Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins.</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.350" end="01:01:35.220">He's over there. Frodo Baggins.</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.420" end="01:01:38.480">He's my second cousin, once removed on his mother's side...</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.660" end="01:01:40.920">...and my third cousin, twice removed....</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.430" end="01:01:47.190">- Pippin! - Steady on, Frodo.</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.730" end="01:02:19.200">You cannot hide.</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.170" end="01:02:25.260">I see you.</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.010" end="01:02:29.700">There is no life...</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.880" end="01:02:32.070">...in the void.</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.240" end="01:02:33.730">Only...</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.680" end="01:02:36.170">...death.</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.190" end="01:02:47.060">You draw far too much attention to yourself, "Mr. Underhill."</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.730" end="01:02:52.760">What do you want?</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.930" end="01:02:54.990">A little more caution from you. That is no trinket you carry.</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.400" end="01:02:58.390">- I carry nothing. - Indeed.</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.700" end="01:03:01.230">I can avoid being seen if I wish...</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.410" end="01:03:05.100">...but to disappear entirely, that is a rare gift.</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.610" end="01:03:08.240">- Who are you? - Are you frightened?</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.450" end="01:03:10.470">Yes.</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.650" end="01:03:14.590">Not nearly frightened enough. I know what hunts you.</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.590" end="01:03:21.120">Let him go! Or I'll have you, Longshanks.</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.800" end="01:03:26.930">You have a stout heart, little Hobbit. But that will not save you.</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.100" end="01:03:30.070">You can no longer wait for the wizard, Frodo.</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.240" end="01:03:31.290">They're coming.</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.890" end="01:04:56.380">What are they?</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.560" end="01:05:00.680">They were once Men.</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.890" end="01:05:03.120">Great kings of Men.</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.630" end="01:05:06.760">Then Sauron the Deceiver gave to them nine rings of power.</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.370" end="01:05:10.490">Blinded by their greed, they took them without question.</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.700" end="01:05:14.040">One by one, falling into darkness.</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.210" end="01:05:16.700">Now they are slaves to his will.</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.080" end="01:05:20.770">They are the Nazgul.</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.010" end="01:05:23.710">Ringwraiths. Neither living nor dead.</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.450" end="01:05:25.920">At all times they feel...</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.090" end="01:05:28.050">...the presence of the Ring...</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.220" end="01:05:32.750">...drawn to the power of the One. They will never stop hunting you.</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.740" end="01:05:45.700">- Where are you taking us? - Into the Wild.</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.880" end="01:05:57.940">How do we know this Strider is a friend of Gandalf?</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.120" end="01:06:00.950">I think a servant of the enemy would look fairer...</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.320" end="01:06:05.260">- ...and feel fouler. - He's foul enough.</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.820" end="01:06:08.730">We have no choice but to trust him.</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.890" end="01:06:12.300">- But where is he leading us? - To Rivendell, Master Gamgee.</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.700" end="01:06:17.970">- To the house of Elrond. - Did you hear that? Rivendell.</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.570" end="01:06:21.300">We're going to see the Elves.</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.960" end="01:06:47.190">- Gentlemen, we do not stop till nightfall. - What about breakfast?</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.370" end="01:06:50.100">- You've already had it. - We've had one, yes.</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.270" end="01:06:52.460">What about second breakfast?</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.870" end="01:06:59.040">Don't think he knows about second breakfast, Pip.</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.280" end="01:07:04.480">What about elevenses? Luncheon? Afternoon tea? Dinner? Supper?</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.680" end="01:07:08.850">- He knows about them, doesn't he? - I wouldn't count on it.</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.330" end="01:07:15.950">Pippin!</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.480" end="01:07:35.910">What do they eat when they can't get Hobbit?</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.750" end="01:08:16.950">Who is she?</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.690" end="01:08:20.250">This woman you sing of.</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.700" end="01:08:26.100">'Tis the lady of Luthien.</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.270" end="01:08:31.430">The Elf-maiden who gave her love to Beren, a mortal.</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.270" end="01:08:35.400">What happened to her?</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.610" end="01:08:40.100">She died.</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.150" end="01:08:46.480">Get some sleep, Frodo.</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.760" end="01:09:00.860">The power of Isengard is at your command...</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.070" end="01:09:05.470">...Sauron, Lord of the Earth.</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.810" end="01:09:14.610">Build me an army worthy of Mordor.</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.190" end="01:09:24.650">What orders from Mordor, my lord? What does the Eye command?</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.120" end="01:09:27.020">We have work to do.</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.640" end="01:10:14.300">The trees are strong, my lord. Their roots go deep.</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.640" end="01:10:16.510">Rip them all down.</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.900" end="01:10:46.840">This was the great watchtower of Amon Sul.</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.540" end="01:10:51.170">We shall rest here tonight.</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.850" end="01:11:06.290">These are for you. Keep them close.</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.530" end="01:11:09.020">I'm going to have a look around.</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.360" end="01:11:13.260">Stay here.</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.800" end="01:11:18.030">My tomato's burst.</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.200" end="01:11:20.100">Could I have some bacon?</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.310" end="01:11:22.270">Want a tomato, Sam?</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.640" end="01:11:26.370">- What are you doing?! - Tomatoes, sausages, nice crispy bacon.</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.550" end="01:11:29.210">- We saved some for you, Mr. Frodo. - Put it out, you fools!</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.410" end="01:11:33.410">- Put it out! - That's nice! Ash on my tomatoes!</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.890" end="01:11:43.590">Go!</p>

<p begin="01:14:49.980" end="01:14:55.480">- Help him, Strider. - He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade.</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.960" end="01:15:01.860">This is beyond my skill to heal. He needs Elvish medicine.</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.470" end="01:15:07.490">Hurry!</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.730" end="01:15:11.670">We're six days from Rivendell! He'll never make it!</p>

<p begin="01:17:59.600" end="01:18:02.470">Mr. Frodo? He's going cold.</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.340" end="01:18:07.110">Is he going to die?</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.310" end="01:18:12.180">He's passing into the Shadow World. He'll soon become a Wraith like them.</p>

<p begin="01:18:21.360" end="01:18:22.850">- Athelas? - Kingsfoil.</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.030" end="01:18:24.120">Kingsfoil, aye, it's a weed.</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.300" end="01:18:27.490">It may help to slow the poisoning. Hurry!</p>

<p begin="01:27:48.260" end="01:27:51.790">- This is wonderful. - I meant to go back...</p>

<p begin="01:27:56.370" end="01:27:58.700">...visit Lake-town...</p>

<p begin="01:28:02.740" end="01:28:07.640">But age, it seems, has finally caught up with me.</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.790" end="01:28:21.550">I miss the Shire.</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.960" end="01:28:27.120">I spent all my childhood pretending I was off somewhere else.</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.400" end="01:28:31.030">Off with you, on one of your adventures.</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.940" end="01:28:37.570">But my own adventure turned out to be quite different.</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.780" end="01:28:45.980">I'm not like you, Bilbo.</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.150" end="01:28:49.420">My dear boy.</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.560" end="01:28:57.490">- Now, what have I forgotten? - Packed already?</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.300" end="01:29:00.090">No harm in being prepared.</p>

<p begin="01:29:03.070" end="01:29:05.930">- More than anything. - I did.</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.140" end="01:29:08.070">It's just....</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.840" end="01:29:11.430">We did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we?</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.640" end="01:29:15.310">We got the Ring this far, to Rivendell. And I thought...</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.510" end="01:29:18.810">...seeing as how you're on the mend, we'd be off soon.</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.020" end="01:29:20.710">Off home.</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.890" end="01:29:26.880">You are right, Sam.</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.090" end="01:29:31.820">We did what we set out to do.</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.400" end="01:29:34.960">The Ring will be safe in Rivendell.</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.100" end="01:29:41.400">I am ready to go home.</p>

<p begin="01:29:44.410" end="01:29:50.140">That wound will never fully heal. He will carry it the rest of his life.</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.720" end="01:29:53.240">And yet to have come so far still bearing the Ring...</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.420" end="01:29:57.150">...the Hobbit has shown extraordinary resilience to its evil.</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.360" end="01:30:00.720">It is a burden he should never have had to bear.</p>

<p begin="01:30:06.560" end="01:30:11.230">Sauron's forces are massing in the East. His Eye is fixed on Rivendell.</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.440" end="01:30:14.200">And Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us.</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.410" end="01:30:17.640">Our list of allies grows thin.</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.380" end="01:30:21.170">His treachery runs deeper than you know.</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.380" end="01:30:25.010">By foul craft, Saruman has crossed Orcs with Goblin-men.</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.220" end="01:30:27.680">He's breeding an army in the caverns of Isengard.</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.950" end="01:30:32.550">An army that can move in sunlight and cover great distance at speed.</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.760" end="01:30:35.160">Saruman is coming for the Ring.</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.560" end="01:30:39.660">This evil cannot be concealed by the power of the Elves.</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.860" end="01:30:44.230">We do not have the strength to fight both Mordor and Isengard!</p>

<p begin="01:31:19.800" end="01:31:23.330">The time of the Elves is over. My people are leaving these shores.</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.010" end="01:31:27.600">Who will you look to when we've gone? The Dwarves?</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.810" end="01:31:32.910">They hide in mountains seeking riches. They care not for the troubles of others.</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.520" end="01:31:37.350">It is in Men that we must place our hope.</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.720" end="01:31:39.420">Men?</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.290" end="01:31:43.520">Men are weak. The race of Men is failing.</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.730" end="01:31:48.130">The blood of Numenor is all but spent, its pride and dignity forgotten.</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.500" end="01:31:51.960">It is because of Men the Ring survives.</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.170" end="01:31:53.800">I was there, Gandalf.</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.470" end="01:31:57.310">I was there 3000 years ago...</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.110" end="01:32:06.550">...when Isildur took the Ring.</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.750" end="01:32:10.620">I was there the day the strength of Men failed.</p>

<p begin="01:32:17.330" end="01:32:20.960">I led Isildur into the heart of Mount Doom...</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.170" end="01:32:24.730">...where the Ring was forged, the one place it could be destroyed.</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.900" end="01:32:27.500">Cast it into the fire!</p>

<p begin="01:32:37.820" end="01:32:39.980">Isildur!</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.420" end="01:32:45.150">It should have ended that day, but evil was allowed to endure.</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.290" end="01:32:53.530">Isildur kept the Ring. The line of kings is broken.</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.430" end="01:32:58.090">There's no strength left in the world of Men.</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.300" end="01:33:03.100">- They're scattered, divided, leaderless. - There is one who could unite them.</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.340" end="01:33:06.670">One who could reclaim the throne of Gondor.</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.410" end="01:33:12.180">He turned from that path a long time ago.</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.380" end="01:33:14.510">He has chosen exile.</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.550" end="01:33:47.570">You are no Elf.</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.750" end="01:33:49.840">Men of the South are welcome here.</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.490" end="01:33:53.980">- Who are you? - I am a friend to Gandalf the Grey.</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.460" end="01:33:58.260">Then we are here on common purpose...</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.660" end="01:34:00.100">...friend.</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.310" end="01:34:18.250">The shards of Narsil.</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.750" end="01:34:26.190">The blade that cut the Ring from Sauron's hand.</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.090" end="01:34:31.320">It's still sharp.</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.270" end="01:34:43.300">But no more than a broken heirloom.</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.130" end="01:35:13.160">Why do you fear the past?</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.040" end="01:35:19.440">You are Isildur's heir, not Isildur himself.</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.640" end="01:35:23.040">You are not bound to his fate.</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.580" end="01:35:27.540">The same blood flows in my veins.</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.590" end="01:35:33.150">The same weakness.</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.860" end="01:35:38.660">Your time will come.</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.830" end="01:35:43.230">You will face the same evil. And you will defeat it.</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.470" end="01:35:48.870">The Shadow does not hold sway yet.</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.870" end="01:35:53.470">Not over you... not over me.</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.860" end="01:36:08.050">Do you remember when we first met?</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.600" end="01:36:16.120">I thought I had strayed into a dream.</p>
<p begin="01:36:16.700" end="01:36:19.190">Long years have passed.</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.900" end="01:36:24.270">You did not have the cares you carry now.</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.740" end="01:36:27.770">Do you remember what I told you?</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.750" end="01:36:36.450">You said you'd bind yourself to me...</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.520" end="01:36:43.460">...forsaking the immortal life of your people.</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.560" end="01:36:46.550">And to that I hold.</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.730" end="01:36:50.330">I would rather share one lifetime with you...</p>
<p begin="01:36:50.570" end="01:36:54.400">...than face all the Ages of this world alone.</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.180" end="01:37:06.640">I choose a mortal life.</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.990" end="01:37:12.250">- You cannot give me this. - It is mine to give to whom I will...</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.460" end="01:37:17.980">...like my heart.</p>
<p begin="01:37:33.810" end="01:37:37.470">Strangers from distant lands, friends of old...</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.680" end="01:37:41.640">...you've been summoned here to answer the threat of Mordor.</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.290" end="01:37:47.160">Middle-earth stands upon the brink of destruction. None can escape it.</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.360" end="01:37:50.880">You will unite, or you will fall.</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.130" end="01:37:55.360">Each race is bound to this fate, this one doom.</p>

<p begin="01:38:14.820" end="01:38:16.510">So it is true.</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.000" end="01:38:36.060">In a dream...</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.710" end="01:38:40.910">...I saw the eastern sky grow dark...</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.210" end="01:38:42.910">...but in the West a pale light lingered.</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.710" end="01:38:45.510">A voice was crying:</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.750" end="01:38:48.680">"Your doom is near at hand.</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.690" end="01:38:52.420">Isildur's Bane is found."</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.460" end="01:38:58.260">Isildur's Bane.</p>
<p begin="01:38:58.860" end="01:39:00.160">Boromir!</p>
<p begin="01:39:23.290" end="01:39:27.120">Never before has any voice uttered the words of that tongue here in Imladris.</p>
<p begin="01:39:27.290" end="01:39:31.060">I do not ask your pardon, Master Elrond...</p>
<p begin="01:39:31.230" end="01:39:33.320">...for the Black Speech of Mordor...</p>
<p begin="01:39:33.600" end="01:39:35.000">...may yet be heard...</p>
<p begin="01:39:35.200" end="01:39:38.130">...in every corner of the West!</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.300" end="01:39:41.000">The Ring is altogether evil.</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.310" end="01:39:42.830">It is a gift.</p>
<p begin="01:39:43.440" end="01:39:45.500">A gift to the foes of Mordor.</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.110" end="01:39:48.240">Why not use this Ring?</p>
<p begin="01:39:48.450" end="01:39:51.210">Long has my father, the Steward of Gondor...</p>
<p begin="01:39:51.420" end="01:39:55.750">...kept the forces of Mordor at bay. By the blood of our people...</p>

<p begin="01:39:59.990" end="01:40:04.360">Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy. Let us use it against him.</p>
<p begin="01:40:04.590" end="01:40:08.330">You cannot wield it. None of us can.</p>
<p begin="01:40:08.930" end="01:40:12.990">The One Ring answers to Sauron alone. It has no other master.</p>
<p begin="01:40:13.240" end="01:40:16.760">And what would a Ranger know of this matter?</p>
<p begin="01:40:17.040" end="01:40:19.030">This is no mere Ranger.</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.010" end="01:40:23.670">He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn.</p>
<p begin="01:40:24.180" end="01:40:27.120">You owe him your allegiance.</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.190" end="01:40:33.120">Aragorn.</p>
<p begin="01:40:34.890" end="01:40:37.690">This is Isildur's heir?</p>
<p begin="01:40:40.030" end="01:40:42.790">And heir to the throne of Gondor.</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.900" end="01:40:46.370">Sit down, Legolas.</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.670" end="01:40:52.510">Gondor has no king.</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.380" end="01:40:56.070">Gondor needs no king.</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.790" end="01:41:06.420">Aragorn is right. We cannot use it.</p>
<p begin="01:41:07.420" end="01:41:10.920">You have only one choice.</p>
<p begin="01:41:11.160" end="01:41:13.490">The Ring must be destroyed.</p>
<p begin="01:41:18.740" end="01:41:21.330">What are we waiting for?</p>
<p begin="01:41:33.420" end="01:41:36.440">The Ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son of Gloin...</p>
<p begin="01:41:36.690" end="01:41:40.880">...by any craft that we here possess.</p>
<p begin="01:41:41.430" end="01:41:45.560">The Ring was made in the fires of Mount Doom.</p>
<p begin="01:41:45.760" end="01:41:49.600">Only there can it be unmade.</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.700" end="01:41:53.260">It must be taken deep into Mordor...</p>
<p begin="01:41:53.470" end="01:41:58.430">...and cast back into the fiery chasm from whence it came.</p>
<p begin="01:42:00.440" end="01:42:02.440">One of you...</p>
<p begin="01:42:02.950" end="01:42:05.110">...must do this.</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.050" end="01:42:11.750">One does not simply walk into Mordor.</p>
<p begin="01:42:12.660" end="01:42:16.290">Its Black Gates are guarded by more than just Orcs.</p>
<p begin="01:42:17.130" end="01:42:21.260">There is evil there that does not sleep.</p>
<p begin="01:42:21.470" end="01:42:25.730">The Great Eye is ever-watchful.</p>
<p begin="01:42:26.470" end="01:42:28.500">It is a barren wasteland...</p>

<p begin="01:42:32.510" end="01:42:36.380">The very air you breathe is a poisonous fume.</p>
<p begin="01:42:36.580" end="01:42:40.880">Not with 10,000 men could you do this. It is folly.</p>
<p begin="01:42:41.080" end="01:42:45.580">Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has said? The Ring must be destroyed.</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.760" end="01:42:48.320">And I suppose you think you are the one to do it!</p>
<p begin="01:42:48.530" end="01:42:53.190">And if we fail, what then? What happens when Sauron takes back what is his?</p>
<p begin="01:42:53.430" end="01:42:58.660">I will be dead before I see the Ring in the hands of an Elf!</p>

<p begin="01:44:21.520" end="01:44:23.780">You have my sword.</p>
<p begin="01:44:25.590" end="01:44:27.680">And you have my bow.</p>
<p begin="01:44:28.260" end="01:44:30.750">And my ax.</p>
<p begin="01:44:37.770" end="01:44:40.760">You carry the fates of us all, little one.</p>
<p begin="01:44:42.770" end="01:44:46.440">If this is indeed the will of the Council...</p>
<p begin="01:44:46.910" end="01:44:49.380">...then Gondor will see it done.</p>
<p begin="01:44:51.950" end="01:44:56.720">- Frodo's not going anywhere without me. - It is hardly possible to separate you...</p>
<p begin="01:44:56.920" end="01:45:01.790">...even when he is summoned to a secret Council and you are not.</p>
<p begin="01:45:02.390" end="01:45:04.290">We're coming too!</p>
<p begin="01:45:06.300" end="01:45:09.090">You'll have to send us home tied up in a sack to stop us.</p>
<p begin="01:45:09.300" end="01:45:12.670">Anyway, you need people of intelligence on this sort of...</p>
<p begin="01:45:13.040" end="01:45:14.300">...mission.</p>
<p begin="01:45:14.540" end="01:45:15.970">Quest.</p>
<p begin="01:45:16.440" end="01:45:17.460">Thing.</p>
<p begin="01:45:19.340" end="01:45:22.070">Well, that rules you out, Pip.</p>
<p begin="01:45:23.610" end="01:45:25.550">Nine companions.</p>
<p begin="01:45:27.320" end="01:45:29.150">So be it.</p>
<p begin="01:45:29.490" end="01:45:32.550">You shall be the Fellowship of the Ring.</p>
<p begin="01:45:33.160" end="01:45:34.990">Great!</p>
<p begin="01:45:35.260" end="01:45:37.490">Where are we going?</p>
<p begin="01:46:13.040" end="01:46:15.560">She wanted to protect her child...</p>
<p begin="01:46:17.410" end="01:46:21.180">she thought in Rivendell you would be safe.</p>
<p begin="01:46:23.350" end="01:46:26.840">In her heart, your mother knew you'd be hunted all your life.</p>
<p begin="01:46:27.320" end="01:46:29.050">That you'd never escape your fate.</p>
<p begin="01:46:29.590" end="01:46:33.180">The skill of the Elves can reforge the sword of kings...</p>
<p begin="01:46:33.630" end="01:46:37.560">...but only you have the power to wield it.</p>
<p begin="01:46:38.600" end="01:46:41.030">I do not want that power.</p>
<p begin="01:46:41.200" end="01:46:43.930">I have never wanted it.</p>
<p begin="01:46:45.200" end="01:46:47.800">You are the last of that bloodline. There is no other.</p>
<p begin="01:46:52.350" end="01:46:54.680">My old sword! Sting.</p>
<p begin="01:46:54.880" end="01:46:56.080">Here, take it. Take it.</p>
<p begin="01:47:01.590" end="01:47:05.460">- It's so light. - Yes. Made by the Elves, you know.</p>
<p begin="01:47:06.160" end="01:47:10.320">The blade glows blue when Orcs are close.</p>
<p begin="01:47:10.530" end="01:47:15.130">And it's times like that, my lad, when you have to be extra careful.</p>
<p begin="01:47:15.340" end="01:47:17.800">Here's a pretty thing.</p>
<p begin="01:47:18.200" end="01:47:19.500">Mithril.</p>
<p begin="01:47:20.310" end="01:47:24.680">As light as a feather, and as hard as dragon scales.</p>
<p begin="01:47:24.880" end="01:47:28.140">Let me see you put it on. Come on.</p>
<p begin="01:47:36.190" end="01:47:38.210">My old ring.</p>
<p begin="01:47:39.490" end="01:47:43.390">I should very much like...</p>
<p begin="01:47:43.630" end="01:47:47.660">...to hold it again, one last time.</p>
<p begin="01:48:05.020" end="01:48:08.680">I'm sorry I brought this upon you, my boy.</p>
<p begin="01:48:09.020" end="01:48:13.080">I'm sorry that you must carry this burden.</p>
<p begin="01:48:17.600" end="01:48:20.690">I'm sorry for everything.</p>
<p begin="01:48:35.880" end="01:48:40.290">The Ring-bearer is setting out on the Quest of Mount Doom.</p>
<p begin="01:48:41.220" end="01:48:43.810">On you who travel with him, no oath...</p>
<p begin="01:48:44.060" end="01:48:47.180">...nor bond is laid to go further than you will.</p>
<p begin="01:48:50.600" end="01:48:53.120">Farewell. Hold to your purpose.</p>
<p begin="01:48:53.600" end="01:48:57.500">May the blessings of Elves and Men...</p>
<p begin="01:48:58.070" end="01:49:00.700">...and all Free Folk go with you.</p>
<p begin="01:49:03.740" end="01:49:07.840">The Fellowship awaits the Ring-bearer.</p>
<p begin="01:49:26.270" end="01:49:28.760">Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right?</p>
<p begin="01:49:29.300" end="01:49:31.130">Left.</p>
<p begin="01:50:50.750" end="01:50:55.190">We must hold to this course, west of the Misty Mountains, for 40 days.</p>
<p begin="01:50:55.390" end="01:50:59.120">If our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan will still be open to us.</p>
<p begin="01:50:59.360" end="01:51:02.920">From there, our road turns east to Mordor.</p>
<p begin="01:51:03.100" end="01:51:06.930">Two, one, five. Good! Very good.</p>
<p begin="01:51:08.730" end="01:51:09.760">Move your feet.</p>
<p begin="01:51:09.970" end="01:51:11.330">- You look good, Pippin. - Thanks.</p>
<p begin="01:51:11.540" end="01:51:12.940">Faster!</p>
<p begin="01:51:14.270" end="01:51:18.110">If anyone was to ask for my opinion, which I note they're not...</p>
<p begin="01:51:18.280" end="01:51:21.040">...I'd say we were taking the long way 'round.</p>
<p begin="01:51:21.550" end="01:51:24.610">Gandalf, we could pass through the Mines of Moria.</p>
<p begin="01:51:25.250" end="01:51:29.120">My cousin Balin would give us a royal welcome.</p>
<p begin="01:51:29.360" end="01:51:34.660">No, I would not take the road through Moria unless I had no other choice.</p>
<p begin="01:51:43.940" end="01:51:45.100">Sorry!</p>
<p begin="01:51:45.810" end="01:51:47.300">Get him!</p>
<p begin="01:51:48.770" end="01:51:51.240">- For the Shire! - Hold him. Hold him down, Merry!</p>
<p begin="01:51:51.780" end="01:51:54.140">Gentlemen, that's enough.</p>
<p begin="01:51:57.920" end="01:51:59.510">You've got my arm! You've got my arm!</p>
<p begin="01:51:59.990" end="01:52:02.610">- What is that? - Nothing. It's just a wisp of cloud.</p>
<p begin="01:52:02.820" end="01:52:05.520">It's moving fast.</p>
<p begin="01:52:05.790" end="01:52:07.950">Against the wind.</p>
<p begin="01:52:08.690" end="01:52:10.820">- Crebain from Dunland! - Hide!</p>
<p begin="01:52:11.030" end="01:52:13.790">- Hurry! - Take cover!</p>
<p begin="01:52:47.200" end="01:52:48.930">Spies of Saruman.</p>
<p begin="01:52:49.700" end="01:52:52.970">The passage south is being watched.</p>
<p begin="01:52:54.070" end="01:52:57.440">We must take the Pass of Caradhras.</p>
<p begin="01:53:10.060" end="01:53:11.750">Frodo!</p>
<p begin="01:53:30.740" end="01:53:33.040">Boromir.</p>
<p begin="01:53:33.250" end="01:53:37.480">It is a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt...</p>
<p begin="01:53:37.680" end="01:53:40.780">...over so small a thing.</p>
<p begin="01:53:44.020" end="01:53:45.990">Such a little thing.</p>
<p begin="01:53:46.190" end="01:53:47.630">Boromir!</p>
<p begin="01:53:48.260" end="01:53:50.920">Give the Ring to Frodo.</p>
<p begin="01:54:00.770" end="01:54:02.800">As you wish.</p>
<p begin="01:54:03.540" end="01:54:05.570">I care not.</p>
<p begin="01:54:40.950" end="01:54:45.650">So, Gandalf, you try to lead them over Caradhras.</p>
<p begin="01:54:45.850" end="01:54:50.450">And if that fails, where then will you go?</p>
<p begin="01:54:51.760" end="01:54:54.690">If the mountain defeats you...</p>
<p begin="01:54:54.930" end="01:54:59.360">...will you risk a more dangerous road?</p>
<p begin="01:55:11.710" end="01:55:14.650">There is a fell voice on the air.</p>
<p begin="01:55:15.710" end="01:55:17.200">It's Saruman!</p>
<p begin="01:55:26.160" end="01:55:30.820">He's trying to bring down the mountain! Gandalf, we must turn back!</p>
<p begin="01:55:31.030" end="01:55:32.860">No!</p>
<p begin="01:56:39.300" end="01:56:41.160">We must get off the mountain!</p>
<p begin="01:56:41.600" end="01:56:45.970">Make for the Gap of Rohan, and take the west road to my city!</p>
<p begin="01:56:46.170" end="01:56:49.540">The Gap of Rohan takes us too close to Isengard!</p>
<p begin="01:56:49.740" end="01:56:53.440">We cannot pass over a mountain. Let us go under it.</p>
<p begin="01:56:53.680" end="01:56:56.480">Let us go through the Mines of Moria.</p>
<p begin="01:56:58.320" end="01:57:02.190">Moria. You fear to go into those mines.</p>
<p begin="01:57:02.820" end="01:57:07.880">The Dwarves delved too greedily and too deep.</p>
<p begin="01:57:08.690" end="01:57:13.560">You know what they awoke in the darkness of Khazad-dum:</p>
<p begin="01:57:14.830" end="01:57:18.330">Shadow and flame.</p>
<p begin="01:57:21.710" end="01:57:24.440">Let the Ring-bearer decide.</p>
<p begin="01:57:29.110" end="01:57:31.280">We cannot stay here!</p>
<p begin="01:57:31.450" end="01:57:34.250">This will be the death of the Hobbits.</p>
<p begin="01:57:34.420" end="01:57:36.080">Frodo?</p>
<p begin="01:57:39.120" end="01:57:41.990">We will go through the mines.</p>
<p begin="01:57:42.800" end="01:57:44.730">So be it.</p>
<p begin="01:57:51.300" end="01:57:55.170">Frodo, come and help an old man.</p>
<p begin="01:57:58.740" end="01:58:00.970">How is your shoulder?</p>
<p begin="01:58:01.150" end="01:58:04.380">- Better than it was. - And the Ring?</p>
<p begin="01:58:05.990" end="01:58:08.480">You feel its power growing, don't you?</p>
<p begin="01:58:08.950" end="01:58:11.860">I've felt it too. You must be careful now.</p>
<p begin="01:58:12.320" end="01:58:16.190">Evil will be drawn to you from outside the Fellowship.</p>
<p begin="01:58:16.360" end="01:58:18.960">And, I fear, from within.</p>
<p begin="01:58:21.570" end="01:58:25.730">- Who then do I trust? - You must trust yourself.</p>
<p begin="01:58:25.900" end="01:58:28.810">Trust your own strengths.</p>
<p begin="01:58:28.970" end="01:58:31.530">- What do you mean? - There are many powers in this world...</p>
<p begin="01:58:31.710" end="01:58:33.800">...for good or for evil.</p>
<p begin="01:58:33.980" end="01:58:36.280">Some are greater than I am.</p>
<p begin="01:58:36.820" end="01:58:40.410">And against some I have not yet been tested.</p>
<p begin="01:58:41.850" end="01:58:43.190">The walls...</p>
<p begin="01:58:43.890" end="01:58:45.980">...of Moria.</p>
<p begin="01:58:51.700" end="01:58:54.690">Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.</p>
<p begin="01:58:54.900" end="01:58:59.360">Yes, Gimli, their own masters cannot find them if their secrets are forgotten.</p>
<p begin="01:58:59.710" end="01:59:02.170">Why doesn't that surprise me?</p>
<p begin="01:59:10.180" end="01:59:13.520">Well, let's see.</p>
<p begin="01:59:13.750" end="01:59:15.120">Ithildin.</p>
<p begin="01:59:15.750" end="01:59:19.120">It mirrors only starlight and moonlight.</p>
<p begin="01:59:33.210" end="01:59:37.270">It reads, "The Doors of Durin, Lord of Moria.</p>
<p begin="01:59:37.880" end="01:59:42.470">- Speak, friend, and enter." - What do you suppose that means?</p>
<p begin="01:59:42.710" end="01:59:47.450">It's simple. If you are a friend, you speak the password and the doors will open.</p>
<p begin="02:00:11.240" end="02:00:12.370">Nothing's happening.</p>
<p begin="02:00:19.380" end="02:00:23.620">I once knew every spell in all the tongues of Elves...</p>
<p begin="02:00:23.890" end="02:00:26.650">...Men and Orcs.</p>
<p begin="02:00:26.960" end="02:00:28.150">What are you going to do, then?</p>
<p begin="02:00:28.430" end="02:00:30.620">Knock your head against these doors, Peregrin Took!</p>
<p begin="02:00:30.900" end="02:00:32.830">And if that does not shatter them...</p>
<p begin="02:00:33.030" end="02:00:35.760">...and I am allowed a little peace from foolish questions...</p>
<p begin="02:00:35.930" end="02:00:39.390">...I will try to find the opening words.</p>
<p begin="02:00:52.220" end="02:00:54.780">Mines are no place for a pony.</p>
<p begin="02:00:55.050" end="02:00:59.150">- Even one so brave as Bill. - Bye-bye, Bill.</p>
<p begin="02:01:00.330" end="02:01:03.120">Go on, Bill. Go on.</p>
<p begin="02:01:03.660" end="02:01:07.190">Don't worry, Sam, he knows the way home.</p>
<p begin="02:01:14.010" end="02:01:16.570">Do not disturb the water.</p>
<p begin="02:01:16.810" end="02:01:18.670">Oh, it's useless.</p>
<p begin="02:01:31.360" end="02:01:33.520">It's a riddle.</p>
<p begin="02:01:36.260" end="02:01:39.390">"Speak 'friend' and enter."</p>
<p begin="02:01:39.770" end="02:01:42.700">What's the Elvish word for "friend"?</p>
<p begin="02:01:44.100" end="02:01:45.400">Mellon.</p>
<p begin="02:02:03.490" end="02:02:08.360">Soon, Master Elf, you will enjoy the fabled hospitality of the Dwarves.</p>
<p begin="02:02:08.790" end="02:02:14.530">Roaring fires, malt beer, ripe meat off the bone!</p>
<p begin="02:02:16.030" end="02:02:19.090">This, my friend, is the home of my cousin Balin.</p>
<p begin="02:02:19.440" end="02:02:21.870">And they call it a mine.</p>
<p begin="02:02:22.070" end="02:02:24.040">A mine!</p>
<p begin="02:02:25.080" end="02:02:28.410">This is no mine. It's a tomb.</p>
<p begin="02:02:34.550" end="02:02:36.110">No....</p>
<p begin="02:02:37.390" end="02:02:39.050">No!</p>

<p begin="02:02:47.130" end="02:02:51.430">We make for the Gap of Rohan. We should never have come here.</p>
<p begin="02:02:52.470" end="02:02:55.070">Now, get out of here. Get out!</p>
<p begin="02:02:57.840" end="02:03:00.240">- Frodo! - Help!</p>
<p begin="02:03:00.450" end="02:03:02.070">Strider!</p>

<p begin="02:04:11.420" end="02:04:15.010">We now have but one choice.</p>
<p begin="02:04:15.220" end="02:04:20.120">We must face the long dark of Moria.</p>
<p begin="02:04:20.360" end="02:04:22.330">Be on your guard.</p>
<p begin="02:04:22.530" end="02:04:25.990">There are older and fouler things than Orcs...</p>

<p begin="02:04:37.680" end="02:04:41.580">Quietly now. It's a four-day journey to the other side.</p>
<p begin="02:04:41.780" end="02:04:45.650">Let us hope that our presence may go unnoticed.</p>
<p begin="02:05:31.430" end="02:05:35.130">The wealth of Moria was not in gold...</p>
<p begin="02:05:35.300" end="02:05:37.730">...or jewels...</p>
<p begin="02:05:37.900" end="02:05:40.930">...but mithril.</p>
<p begin="02:05:59.290" end="02:06:04.160">Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings that Thorin gave him.</p>
<p begin="02:06:04.430" end="02:06:08.370">- Oh, that was a kingly gift. - Yes.</p>
<p begin="02:06:08.530" end="02:06:10.470">I never told him...</p>
<p begin="02:06:10.640" end="02:06:15.600">...but its worth was greater than the value of the Shire.</p>
<p begin="02:06:27.950" end="02:06:29.650">Pippin.</p>
<p begin="02:06:50.010" end="02:06:52.980">I have no memory of this place.</p>
<p begin="02:06:55.010" end="02:06:56.480">- Are we lost? - No.</p>
<p begin="02:06:56.650" end="02:06:59.170">- I think we are. - Gandalf's thinking.</p>
<p begin="02:06:59.380" end="02:07:00.850">- Merry? - What?</p>
<p begin="02:07:01.050" end="02:07:02.990">I'm hungry.</p>
<p begin="02:07:14.370" end="02:07:18.800">- There's something down there. - It's Gollum.</p>
<p begin="02:07:19.000" end="02:07:23.100">- Gollum? - He's been following us for three days.</p>
<p begin="02:07:23.340" end="02:07:27.510">- He escaped the dungeons of Barad-dur? - Escaped...</p>
<p begin="02:07:28.210" end="02:07:29.840">...or was set loose.</p>
<p begin="02:07:30.380" end="02:07:34.010">Now the Ring has brought him here.</p>
<p begin="02:07:36.620" end="02:07:39.420">He will never be rid of his need for it.</p>
<p begin="02:07:39.590" end="02:07:45.290">He hates and loves the Ring, as he hates and loves himself.</p>
<p begin="02:07:45.460" end="02:07:50.370">Smeagol's life is a sad story.</p>
<p begin="02:07:50.540" end="02:07:56.470">Yes, Smeagol he was once called. Before the Ring found him.</p>
<p begin="02:07:57.440" end="02:08:00.240">Before it drove him mad.</p>
<p begin="02:08:00.480" end="02:08:03.380">It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him when he had the chance.</p>
<p begin="02:08:03.580" end="02:08:04.780">Pity?</p>
<p begin="02:08:05.850" end="02:08:08.790">It is pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.</p>
<p begin="02:08:09.650" end="02:08:14.890">Many that live deserve death. Some that die deserve life.</p>
<p begin="02:08:16.360" end="02:08:18.800">Can you give it to them, Frodo?</p>
<p begin="02:08:21.230" end="02:08:25.170">Do not be too eager to deal out death and judgment.</p>
<p begin="02:08:25.400" end="02:08:28.300">Even the very wise cannot see all ends.</p>
<p begin="02:08:28.910" end="02:08:34.810">My heart tells me that Gollum has some part to play yet, for good or ill...</p>
<p begin="02:08:35.610" end="02:08:38.480">...before this is over.</p>
<p begin="02:08:39.990" end="02:08:43.820">The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many.</p>
<p begin="02:08:50.500" end="02:08:53.830">I wish the Ring had never come to me.</p>
<p begin="02:08:55.270" end="02:08:57.330">I wish none of this had happened.</p>
<p begin="02:08:57.500" end="02:09:02.530">So do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide.</p>
<p begin="02:09:03.340" end="02:09:08.840">All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.</p>
<p begin="02:09:10.350" end="02:09:14.340">There are other forces at work in this world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.</p>
<p begin="02:09:14.720" end="02:09:17.190">Bilbo was meant to find the Ring.</p>
<p begin="02:09:17.690" end="02:09:22.020">In which case, you also were meant to have it.</p>
<p begin="02:09:22.260" end="02:09:25.350">And that is an encouraging thought.</p>
<p begin="02:09:30.240" end="02:09:32.200">It's that way.</p>
<p begin="02:09:32.470" end="02:09:34.770">- He's remembered. - No.</p>
<p begin="02:09:34.970" end="02:09:38.770">But the air doesn't smell so foul down here.</p>
<p begin="02:09:38.980" end="02:09:44.180">If in doubt, Meriadoc, always follow your nose.</p>
<p begin="02:09:59.000" end="02:10:03.160">Let me risk a little more light.</p>
<p begin="02:10:07.810" end="02:10:09.870">Behold...</p>
<p begin="02:10:10.310" end="02:10:15.580">...the great realm and Dwarf-city of Dwarrowdelf.</p>
<p begin="02:10:18.020" end="02:10:21.450">There's an eye opener, and no mistake.</p>
<p begin="02:10:46.380" end="02:10:48.110">Gimli!</p>
<p begin="02:10:55.520" end="02:10:57.150">No!</p>
<p begin="02:10:59.720" end="02:11:02.890">Oh, no.</p>
<p begin="02:11:04.730" end="02:11:05.990">No.</p>
<p begin="02:11:13.270" end="02:11:15.260">"Here lies Balin...</p>
<p begin="02:11:15.740" end="02:11:17.730">...son of Fundin...</p>
<p begin="02:11:18.040" end="02:11:20.670">...Lord of Moria."</p>
<p begin="02:11:21.750" end="02:11:23.410">He is dead, then.</p>
<p begin="02:11:25.150" end="02:11:26.850">It's as I feared.</p>
<p begin="02:11:45.070" end="02:11:47.970">We must move on. We cannot linger.</p>
<p begin="02:11:48.210" end="02:11:52.910">"They have taken the bridge and the second hall.</p>
<p begin="02:11:53.980" end="02:11:56.570">We have barred the gates...</p>
<p begin="02:11:57.250" end="02:11:59.740">...but cannot hold them for long.</p>
<p begin="02:11:59.920" end="02:12:02.750">The ground shakes.</p>
<p begin="02:12:03.190" end="02:12:04.750">Drums...</p>
<p begin="02:12:05.120" end="02:12:08.490">...drums in the deep.</p>
<p begin="02:12:12.060" end="02:12:14.090">We cannot get out.</p>
<p begin="02:12:16.100" end="02:12:19.930">A Shadow moves in the dark.</p>
<p begin="02:12:21.610" end="02:12:24.200">We cannot get out.</p>
<p begin="02:12:27.210" end="02:12:29.110">They are coming."</p>
<p begin="02:13:12.160" end="02:13:13.990">Fool of a Took!</p>
<p begin="02:13:14.360" end="02:13:18.160">Throw yourself in next time, and rid us of your stupidity.</p>
<p begin="02:13:44.190" end="02:13:45.880">Frodo!</p>
<p begin="02:13:48.190" end="02:13:49.660">Orcs.</p>
<p begin="02:13:56.670" end="02:13:58.660">Get back! Stay close to Gandalf!</p>
<p begin="02:14:05.780" end="02:14:07.610">They have a cave-troll.</p>
<p begin="02:14:23.430" end="02:14:24.590">Let them come!</p>
<p begin="02:14:25.100" end="02:14:28.620">There is one Dwarf yet in Moria who still draws breath.</p>
<p begin="02:16:47.510" end="02:16:50.270">I think I'm getting the hang of this.</p>
<p begin="02:16:54.980" end="02:16:56.740">Frodo!</p>
<p begin="02:17:30.280" end="02:17:32.150">Aragorn! Aragorn!</p>
<p begin="02:17:33.150" end="02:17:35.020">Frodo!</p>
<p begin="02:18:20.200" end="02:18:22.060">Frodo!</p>
<p begin="02:19:22.290" end="02:19:23.590">Oh, no.</p>
<p begin="02:19:31.970" end="02:19:33.900">He's alive.</p>
<p begin="02:19:36.340" end="02:19:39.310">I'm all right. I'm not hurt.</p>
<p begin="02:19:39.540" end="02:19:41.740">You should be dead.</p>
<p begin="02:19:41.950" end="02:19:44.440">That spear would have skewered a wild boar.</p>
<p begin="02:19:44.650" end="02:19:49.420">I think there's more to this Hobbit than meets the eye.</p>
<p begin="02:19:55.290" end="02:19:56.320">Mithril.</p>
<p begin="02:19:59.130" end="02:20:01.760">You are full of surprises, Master Baggins.</p>
<p begin="02:20:07.770" end="02:20:09.670">To the Bridge of Khazad-dum!</p>
<p begin="02:20:24.720" end="02:20:26.380">This way!</p>
<p begin="02:21:36.760" end="02:21:39.750">What is this new devilry?</p>
<p begin="02:21:55.810" end="02:21:58.610">A Balrog.</p>
<p begin="02:21:58.950" end="02:22:02.080">A demon of the ancient world.</p>
<p begin="02:22:04.290" end="02:22:06.720">This foe is beyond any of you.</p>
<p begin="02:22:07.890" end="02:22:09.450">Run!</p>
<p begin="02:22:16.800" end="02:22:18.290">Quickly!</p>
<p begin="02:22:34.920" end="02:22:36.220">Gandalf.</p>
<p begin="02:22:36.820" end="02:22:38.410">Lead them on, Aragorn.</p>
<p begin="02:22:39.820" end="02:22:42.320">The bridge is near.</p>
<p begin="02:22:44.360" end="02:22:48.490">Do as I say! Swords are no more use here.</p>
<p begin="02:23:17.630" end="02:23:19.360">Gandalf!</p>
<p begin="02:23:37.650" end="02:23:38.880">Merry! Pippin!</p>
<p begin="02:23:49.990" end="02:23:51.520">Sam!</p>
<p begin="02:23:54.230" end="02:23:57.500">Nobody tosses a Dwarf.</p>
<p begin="02:24:00.540" end="02:24:01.940">Not the beard!</p>
<p begin="02:24:15.190" end="02:24:17.090">Steady.</p>
<p begin="02:24:19.190" end="02:24:20.850">Hold on!</p>
<p begin="02:24:41.910" end="02:24:43.110">Hang on!</p>
<p begin="02:24:53.890" end="02:24:55.620">Lean forward!</p>
<p begin="02:24:58.600" end="02:24:59.620">Steady.</p>
<p begin="02:25:00.930" end="02:25:02.090">Come on!</p>
<p begin="02:25:02.330" end="02:25:03.820">Now!</p>
<p begin="02:25:20.990" end="02:25:22.850">Over the bridge!</p>
<p begin="02:25:23.050" end="02:25:24.610">Fly!</p>
<p begin="02:26:09.200" end="02:26:11.290">You cannot pass!</p>
<p begin="02:26:11.470" end="02:26:13.030">Gandalf!</p>
<p begin="02:26:17.310" end="02:26:22.180">I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.</p>
<p begin="02:26:23.180" end="02:26:26.980">The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udun!</p>
<p begin="02:26:36.960" end="02:26:38.930">Go back to the Shadow.</p>
<p begin="02:26:46.740" end="02:26:51.200">You shall not pass!</p>
<p begin="02:27:18.370" end="02:27:22.240">- No! No! - Gandalf!</p>
<p begin="02:27:29.910" end="02:27:32.380">Fly, you fools!</p>
<p begin="02:27:36.520" end="02:27:38.680">No!</p>
<p begin="02:27:44.800" end="02:27:46.990">Aragorn!</p>
<p begin="02:28:44.290" end="02:28:47.090">Legolas, get them up.</p>
<p begin="02:28:51.160" end="02:28:53.060">Give them a moment, for pity's sake!</p>
<p begin="02:28:53.260" end="02:28:56.860">By nightfall, these hills will be swarming with Orcs.</p>
<p begin="02:28:57.100" end="02:29:00.430">We must reach the woods of Lothlorien.</p>
<p begin="02:29:01.340" end="02:29:04.640">Come, Boromir. Legolas. Gimli, get them up.</p>
<p begin="02:29:06.140" end="02:29:08.340">On your feet, Sam.</p>
<p begin="02:29:08.680" end="02:29:10.170">Frodo?</p>
<p begin="02:29:12.220" end="02:29:13.950">Frodo!</p>
<p begin="02:30:06.440" end="02:30:09.000">Stay close, young Hobbits!</p>
<p begin="02:30:09.740" end="02:30:13.870">They say that a great sorceress lives in these woods.</p>
<p begin="02:30:14.080" end="02:30:16.640">An Elf-witch...</p>
<p begin="02:30:17.180" end="02:30:20.050">...of terrible power.</p>
<p begin="02:30:20.580" end="02:30:22.780">All who look upon her...</p>
<p begin="02:30:23.020" end="02:30:24.780">...fall under her spell.</p>
<p begin="02:30:25.020" end="02:30:26.280">Frodo!</p>
<p begin="02:30:28.560" end="02:30:30.580">And are never seen again.</p>
<p begin="02:30:30.790" end="02:30:35.290">Your coming to us is as the footsteps of doom.</p>
<p begin="02:30:35.530" end="02:30:39.230">You bring great evil here, Ring-bearer.</p>
<p begin="02:30:39.440" end="02:30:41.200">Mr. Frodo?</p>
<p begin="02:30:46.480" end="02:30:52.070">Well, here's one Dwarf she won't ensnare so easily.</p>
<p begin="02:30:52.280" end="02:30:56.810">I have the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox.</p>
<p begin="02:31:04.490" end="02:31:09.090">The Dwarf breathes so loud, we could have shot him in the dark.</p>
<p begin="02:31:14.240" end="02:31:16.230">Welcome Legolas, son of Thranduil.</p>
<p begin="02:31:17.140" end="02:31:19.800">Our Fellowship stands in your debt.</p>
<p begin="02:31:22.610" end="02:31:24.310">Aragorn of the Dunedain...</p>
<p begin="02:31:24.950" end="02:31:26.350">you are known to us.</p>
<p begin="02:31:27.250" end="02:31:29.510">So much for the legendary courtesy of the Elves!</p>
<p begin="02:31:29.720" end="02:31:31.620">Speak words we can all understand!</p>
<p begin="02:31:31.790" end="02:31:36.350">We have not had dealings with the Dwarves since the Dark Days.</p>
<p begin="02:31:36.630" end="02:31:39.150">And you know what this Dwarf says to that?</p>
<p begin="02:31:46.000" end="02:31:47.970">That was not so courteous.</p>
<p begin="02:31:54.510" end="02:31:58.540">You bring great evil with you.</p>
<p begin="02:32:00.320" end="02:32:02.510">You can go no further.</p>
<p begin="02:32:39.920" end="02:32:42.550">Gandalf's death was not in vain.</p>
<p begin="02:32:43.690" end="02:32:45.590">Nor would he have you give up hope.</p>
<p begin="02:32:47.100" end="02:32:50.430">You carry a heavy burden, Frodo.</p>
<p begin="02:32:51.300" end="02:32:54.400">Don't carry the weight of the dead.</p>
<p begin="02:32:57.240" end="02:32:59.300">You will follow me.</p>
<p begin="02:33:11.020" end="02:33:12.960">Caras Galadhon.</p>
<p begin="02:33:13.590" end="02:33:16.560">The heart of Elvendom on earth.</p>
<p begin="02:33:16.730" end="02:33:22.390">Realm of the Lord Celeborn and of Galadriel, Lady of Light.</p>
<p begin="02:34:41.510" end="02:34:44.610">The enemy knows you have entered here.</p>
<p begin="02:34:45.280" end="02:34:50.450">What hope you had in secrecy is now gone.</p>
<p begin="02:34:52.190" end="02:34:56.630">Eight there are here, yet nine there were set out from Rivendell.</p>
<p begin="02:34:56.860" end="02:34:58.690">Tell me, where is Gandalf?</p>
<p begin="02:34:58.860" end="02:35:01.990">For I much desire to speak with him.</p>
<p begin="02:35:02.170" end="02:35:04.960">I can no longer see him from afar.</p>
<p begin="02:35:05.840" end="02:35:11.000">Gandalf the Grey did not pass the borders of this land.</p>
<p begin="02:35:11.240" end="02:35:13.710">He has fallen into Shadow.</p>
<p begin="02:35:18.380" end="02:35:22.880">He was taken by both Shadow and flame.</p>
<p begin="02:35:24.550" end="02:35:28.250">A Balrog of Morgoth.</p>
<p begin="02:35:28.990" end="02:35:32.360">For we went needlessly into the net of Moria.</p>
<p begin="02:35:34.500" end="02:35:37.730">Needless were none of the deeds of Gandalf in life.</p>
<p begin="02:35:38.370" end="02:35:41.670">We do not yet know his full purpose.</p>
<p begin="02:35:46.410" end="02:35:50.740">Do not let the great emptiness of Khazad-dum fill your heart...</p>
<p begin="02:35:50.910" end="02:35:53.250">...Gimli, son of Gloin.</p>
<p begin="02:35:54.250" end="02:35:57.780">For the world has grown full of peril...</p>
<p begin="02:35:59.260" end="02:36:01.920">...and in all lands...</p>
<p begin="02:36:02.090" end="02:36:05.580">...love is now mingled with grief.</p>
<p begin="02:36:18.240" end="02:36:20.940">What now becomes of this Fellowship?</p>
<p begin="02:36:21.510" end="02:36:24.500">Without Gandalf, hope is lost.</p>
<p begin="02:36:27.450" end="02:36:30.750">The quest stands upon the edge of a knife.</p>
<p begin="02:36:30.920" end="02:36:34.010">Stray but a little and it will fail...</p>
<p begin="02:36:34.760" end="02:36:37.590">...to the ruin of all.</p>
<p begin="02:36:41.930" end="02:36:47.770">Yet hope remains while the Company is true.</p>
<p begin="02:36:49.310" end="02:36:54.070">Do not let your hearts be troubled. Go now and rest...</p>
<p begin="02:36:54.480" end="02:36:58.140">...for you are weary with sorrow and much toil.</p>
<p begin="02:37:00.420" end="02:37:02.540">Tonight, you will sleep....</p>
<p begin="02:37:02.820" end="02:37:06.260">Welcome, Frodo of the Shire...</p>
<p begin="02:37:07.690" end="02:37:09.490">...one who has seen the Eye!</p>
<p begin="02:37:24.140" end="02:37:26.700">A lament for Gandalf.</p>
<p begin="02:37:33.980" end="02:37:35.510">What do they say about him?</p>
<p begin="02:37:35.850" end="02:37:38.450">I have not the heart to tell you.</p>
<p begin="02:37:41.360" end="02:37:43.590">For me, the grief is still too near.</p>
<p begin="02:37:46.560" end="02:37:49.400">I bet they don't mention his fireworks.</p>
<p begin="02:37:49.570" end="02:37:52.590">There should be a verse about them.</p>
<p begin="02:37:56.070" end="02:37:58.060">The finest rockets ever seen</p>
<p begin="02:37:59.180" end="02:38:02.010">They burst in stars of blue and green</p>
<p begin="02:38:02.950" end="02:38:08.150">Or after thunder, silver showers</p>
<p begin="02:38:08.850" end="02:38:11.650">Came falling like a rain of flowers</p>
<p begin="02:38:11.820" end="02:38:15.720">Oh, that doesn't do them justice by a long road.</p>
<p begin="02:38:26.500" end="02:38:29.200">Take some rest.</p>
<p begin="02:38:29.410" end="02:38:32.070">These borders are well-protected.</p>
<p begin="02:38:32.280" end="02:38:34.800">I will find no rest here.</p>
<p begin="02:38:37.650" end="02:38:40.640">I heard her voice inside my head.</p>
<p begin="02:38:40.980" end="02:38:44.610">She spoke of my father and the fall of Gondor.</p>
<p begin="02:38:44.820" end="02:38:50.280">She said to me, "Even now there is hope left."</p>
<p begin="02:38:51.660" end="02:38:54.490">But I cannot see it.</p>
<p begin="02:38:55.830" end="02:38:58.320">It is long since we had any hope.</p>
<p begin="02:39:08.510" end="02:39:10.640">My father is a noble man.</p>
<p begin="02:39:11.450" end="02:39:13.640">But his rule is failing...</p>
<p begin="02:39:16.790" end="02:39:19.380">...and our people lose faith.</p>
<p begin="02:39:20.820" end="02:39:24.350">He looks to me to make things right, and I would do it.</p>
<p begin="02:39:24.530" end="02:39:28.050">I would see the glory of Gondor restored.</p>
<p begin="02:39:30.900" end="02:39:33.890">Have you ever seen it, Aragorn?</p>
<p begin="02:39:34.540" end="02:39:36.560">The White Tower of Ecthelion.</p>
<p begin="02:39:36.770" end="02:39:40.570">Glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver.</p>
<p begin="02:39:41.280" end="02:39:44.770">Its banners caught high in the morning breeze.</p>
<p begin="02:39:47.650" end="02:39:49.640">Have you ever been called home...</p>
<p begin="02:39:49.820" end="02:39:53.720">...by the clear ringing of silver trumpets?</p>
<p begin="02:39:54.360" end="02:39:57.590">I have seen the White City...</p>
<p begin="02:39:57.930" end="02:39:59.420">...long ago.</p>
<p begin="02:40:00.400" end="02:40:05.360">One day, our paths will lead us there.</p>
<p begin="02:40:06.340" end="02:40:09.240">And the tower guard shall take up the call:</p>
<p begin="02:40:09.710" end="02:40:13.040">"The Lords of Gondor have returned."</p>
<p begin="02:41:20.240" end="02:41:22.770">Will you look into the mirror?</p>
<p begin="02:41:22.950" end="02:41:24.470">What will I see?</p>
<p begin="02:41:27.450" end="02:41:29.780">Even the wisest cannot tell.</p>
<p begin="02:41:30.690" end="02:41:32.520">For the mirror...</p>
<p begin="02:41:32.760" end="02:41:35.280">...shows many things.</p>
<p begin="02:41:38.290" end="02:41:40.660">Things that were...</p>
<p begin="02:41:40.900" end="02:41:43.460">...things that are...</p>
<p begin="02:41:44.200" end="02:41:46.170">...and some things...</p>
<p begin="02:41:49.770" end="02:41:53.110">...that have not yet come to pass.</p>
<p begin="02:43:15.630" end="02:43:18.490">I know what it is you saw.</p>
<p begin="02:43:20.900" end="02:43:23.390">For it is also in my mind.</p>
<p begin="02:43:25.170" end="02:43:29.200">It is what will come to pass ifyou should fail.</p>
<p begin="02:43:31.610" end="02:43:36.480">The Fellowship is breaking. It is already begun.</p>
<p begin="02:43:37.110" end="02:43:40.410">He will try to take the Ring.</p>
<p begin="02:43:40.620" end="02:43:42.610">You know of whom I speak.</p>
<p begin="02:43:43.620" end="02:43:48.280">One by one, it will destroy them all.</p>
<p begin="02:43:49.790" end="02:43:52.230">If you ask it of me...</p>
<p begin="02:43:52.630" end="02:43:55.690">...I will give you the One Ring.</p>
<p begin="02:43:56.730" end="02:43:58.930">You offer it to me freely.</p>
<p begin="02:44:03.510" end="02:44:07.440">I do not deny that my heart has greatly desired this.</p>
<p begin="02:44:13.820" end="02:44:17.080">In place of a Dark Lord, you would have a queen...</p>
<p begin="02:44:17.550" end="02:44:21.350">...not dark but beautiful, and terrible as the dawn!</p>
<p begin="02:44:21.990" end="02:44:25.020">Treacherous as the sea!</p>
<p begin="02:44:25.530" end="02:44:30.470">Stronger than the foundations of the earth!</p>
<p begin="02:44:30.900" end="02:44:33.270">All shall love me...</p>
<p begin="02:44:33.500" end="02:44:36.340">...and despair.</p>
<p begin="02:44:50.420" end="02:44:54.750">I pass the test. I will diminish...</p>
<p begin="02:44:55.030" end="02:44:57.490">...and go into the West...</p>
<p begin="02:44:57.690" end="02:45:02.130">- ...and remain Galadriel. - I cannot do this alone.</p>
<p begin="02:45:05.770" end="02:45:09.900">You are a Ring-bearer, Frodo. To bear a Ring of Power...</p>
<p begin="02:45:10.810" end="02:45:12.300">...is to be alone.</p>
<p begin="02:45:15.750" end="02:45:18.510">This is Nenya, the Ring of Adamant.</p>
<p begin="02:45:18.720" end="02:45:20.310">And I am its keeper.</p>
<p begin="02:45:23.520" end="02:45:27.150">This task was appointed to you.</p>
<p begin="02:45:28.190" end="02:45:31.060">And if you do not find a way...</p>
<p begin="02:45:32.260" end="02:45:34.250">...no one will.</p>
<p begin="02:45:34.670" end="02:45:37.830">Then I know what I must do.</p>
<p begin="02:45:38.500" end="02:45:39.700">It's just...</p>
<p begin="02:45:42.940" end="02:45:45.200">...I'm afraid to do it.</p>
<p begin="02:45:48.710" end="02:45:53.840">Even the smallest person can change the course of the future.</p>
<p begin="02:45:59.190" end="02:46:04.920">Do you know how the Orcs first came into being?</p>
<p begin="02:46:05.700" end="02:46:09.030">They were Elves once.</p>
<p begin="02:46:10.200" end="02:46:13.530">Taken by the Dark Powers...</p>
<p begin="02:46:13.740" end="02:46:16.900">...tortured and mutilated.</p>
<p begin="02:46:17.240" end="02:46:22.540">A ruined and terrible form of life.</p>
<p begin="02:46:22.810" end="02:46:24.680">And now...</p>
<p begin="02:46:26.120" end="02:46:27.980">...perfected.</p>
<p begin="02:46:28.720" end="02:46:31.880">My fighting Uruk-hai...</p>
<p begin="02:46:33.820" end="02:46:36.160">...whom do you serve?</p>
<p begin="02:46:36.330" end="02:46:38.820">Saruman!</p>
<p begin="02:46:59.720" end="02:47:03.120">Hunt them down. Do not stop until they are found.</p>
<p begin="02:47:03.320" end="02:47:06.260">You do not know pain. You do not know fear.</p>
<p begin="02:47:06.460" end="02:47:09.430">You will taste Man-flesh!</p>
<p begin="02:47:14.460" end="02:47:18.160">One of the halflings carries something of great value.</p>
<p begin="02:47:18.340" end="02:47:22.530">Bring them to me alive and unspoiled.</p>
<p begin="02:47:24.340" end="02:47:25.640">Kill the others.</p>
<p begin="02:47:44.830" end="02:47:50.290">Never before have we clad strangers in the garb of our own people.</p>
<p begin="02:47:51.340" end="02:47:55.140">May these cloaks help shield you from unfriendly eyes.</p>
<p begin="02:48:02.350" end="02:48:03.970">Lembas.</p>
<p begin="02:48:04.210" end="02:48:05.810">Elvish waybread.</p>
<p begin="02:48:08.320" end="02:48:11.310">One small bite is enough to fill the stomach of a grown man.</p>
<p begin="02:48:17.790" end="02:48:19.760">How many did you eat?</p>
<p begin="02:48:19.930" end="02:48:21.590">Four.</p>
<p begin="02:48:27.370" end="02:48:30.000">Every league you travel south, the danger will increase.</p>
<p begin="02:48:30.170" end="02:48:34.300">Mordor Orcs now hold the eastern shore of the Anduin.</p>
<p begin="02:48:34.480" end="02:48:36.970">Nor will you find safety on the western bank.</p>
<p begin="02:48:37.180" end="02:48:41.010">Strange creatures bearing the White Hand have been seen on our borders.</p>
<p begin="02:48:41.180" end="02:48:46.280">Seldom do Orcs journey in the open under the sun, yet these have done so.</p>
<p begin="02:48:54.970" end="02:48:57.530">You are being tracked.</p>
<p begin="02:48:58.970" end="02:49:03.570">By river you have the chance of outrunning the enemy to the Falls of Rauros.</p>
<p begin="02:49:20.890" end="02:49:25.690">My gift for you, Legolas, is a bow of the Galadhrim.</p>
<p begin="02:49:25.860" end="02:49:29.350">Worthy of the skill of our woodland kin.</p>
<p begin="02:49:34.740" end="02:49:37.210">These are the daggers of the Noldorin.</p>
<p begin="02:49:37.370" end="02:49:41.370">They have already seen service in war.</p>
<p begin="02:49:41.550" end="02:49:43.840">Do not fear, young Peregrin Took.</p>
<p begin="02:49:44.010" end="02:49:47.310">You will find your courage.</p>
<p begin="02:49:49.190" end="02:49:51.180">And for you, Samwise Gamgee...</p>
<p begin="02:49:51.350" end="02:49:53.880">...Elven rope made of hithlain.</p>
<p begin="02:49:54.220" end="02:49:56.350">Thank you, my lady.</p>
<p begin="02:49:58.200" end="02:50:01.530">Have you run out of those nice, shiny daggers?</p>
<p begin="02:50:07.940" end="02:50:10.960">And what gift would a dwarf ask of the Elves?</p>
<p begin="02:50:11.140" end="02:50:13.270">Nothing.</p>
<p begin="02:50:13.910" end="02:50:17.240">Except to look upon the lady of the Galadhrim one last time...</p>
<p begin="02:50:17.880" end="02:50:23.080">...for she is more fair than all the jewels beneath the earth.</p>
<p begin="02:50:30.130" end="02:50:31.720">Actually....</p>
<p begin="02:50:31.900" end="02:50:33.520">There was one thing.</p>
<p begin="02:50:34.330" end="02:50:36.990">No, no, I couldn't. It's quite impossible.</p>
<p begin="02:50:37.170" end="02:50:39.970">Stupid to ask.</p>
<p begin="02:50:42.540" end="02:50:44.630">I have nothing greater to give...</p>
<p begin="02:50:44.810" end="02:50:48.400">...than the gift you already bear.</p>
<p begin="02:50:49.510" end="02:50:50.540">For her love,</p>
<p begin="02:50:51.850" end="02:50:57.180">I fear the grace of Arwen Evenstar will diminish.</p>
<p begin="02:50:57.950" end="02:51:01.290">I would have her leave these shores,</p>
<p begin="02:51:02.830" end="02:51:05.730">and be with her people.</p>
<p begin="02:51:07.730" end="02:51:13.470">I would have her take the ship to Valinor.</p>
<p begin="02:51:13.740" end="02:51:16.800">That choice is yet before her.</p>
<p begin="02:51:17.540" end="02:51:20.440">You have your own choice to make, Aragorn.</p>
<p begin="02:51:20.740" end="02:51:26.580">To rise above the height of all your fathers since the days of Elendil...</p>
<p begin="02:51:26.750" end="02:51:31.080">...or to fall into darkness with all that is left of your kin.</p>
<p begin="02:51:38.360" end="02:51:39.660">Farewell.</p>
<p begin="02:51:43.530" end="02:51:46.900">There is much you have yet to do.</p>
<p begin="02:51:53.410" end="02:51:54.710">We shall not meet again...</p>
<p begin="02:51:54.880" end="02:51:56.240">Elessar.</p>
<p begin="02:51:58.680" end="02:52:01.880">Farewell, Frodo Baggins.</p>
<p begin="02:52:02.050" end="02:52:05.490">I give you the light of Earendil...</p>
<p begin="02:52:06.320" end="02:52:08.660">...our most beloved star.</p>
<p begin="02:52:17.800" end="02:52:22.200">May it be a light for you in dark places...</p>
<p begin="02:52:22.410" end="02:52:26.540">...when all other lights go out.</p>
<p begin="02:52:35.420" end="02:52:38.580">I have taken my worst wound at this parting...</p>
<p begin="02:52:39.220" end="02:52:43.520">...having looked my last upon that which is fairest.</p>
<p begin="02:52:44.260" end="02:52:47.590">Henceforth I will call nothing fair unless it be her gift to me.</p>
<p begin="02:52:47.830" end="02:52:49.800">What was her gift?</p>
<p begin="02:52:49.970" end="02:52:54.900">I asked her for one hair from her golden head.</p>
<p begin="02:52:55.670" end="02:52:58.570">She gave me three.</p>
<p begin="02:54:40.740" end="02:54:44.180">Gollum. He has tracked us since Moria.</p>
<p begin="02:54:47.920" end="02:54:51.010">I had hoped we would lose him on the river.</p>
<p begin="02:54:51.250" end="02:54:54.420">But he's too clever a waterman.</p>
<p begin="02:54:55.260" end="02:54:58.560">And if he alerts the enemy to our whereabouts...</p>
<p begin="02:54:58.730" end="02:55:00.960">...it will make the crossing even more dangerous.</p>
<p begin="02:55:01.160" end="02:55:03.220">Have some food, Mr. Frodo.</p>
<p begin="02:55:03.400" end="02:55:06.460">- No, Sam. - You haven't eaten anything all day.</p>
<p begin="02:55:06.670" end="02:55:09.760">You're not sleeping, neither. Don't think I haven't noticed.</p>
<p begin="02:55:10.710" end="02:55:13.700">- Mr. Frodo-- - I'm all right.</p>
<p begin="02:55:13.940" end="02:55:15.100">But you're not.</p>
<p begin="02:55:15.410" end="02:55:17.900">I'm here to help you.</p>
<p begin="02:55:18.080" end="02:55:19.780">I promised Gandalf that I would.</p>
<p begin="02:55:25.760" end="02:55:28.490">You can't help me, Sam.</p>
<p begin="02:55:30.630" end="02:55:32.390">Not this time.</p>
<p begin="02:55:35.270" end="02:55:37.390">Get some sleep.</p>
<p begin="02:55:43.610" end="02:55:45.800">Minas Tirith is the safer road.</p>
<p begin="02:55:46.340" end="02:55:49.110">You know that. From there we can regroup.</p>
<p begin="02:55:49.780" end="02:55:52.010">Strike out for Mordor from a place of strength.</p>
<p begin="02:55:52.280" end="02:55:55.150">There is no strength in Gondor that can avail us.</p>
<p begin="02:55:55.620" end="02:55:57.610">You were quick enough to trust the Elves.</p>
<p begin="02:55:59.490" end="02:56:02.320">Have you so little faith in your own people?</p>
<p begin="02:56:02.490" end="02:56:05.480">Yes, there is weakness. There is frailty.</p>
<p begin="02:56:05.660" end="02:56:09.000">But there is courage also, and honor to be found in Men.</p>
<p begin="02:56:09.230" end="02:56:11.430">But you will not see that.</p>
<p begin="02:56:11.770" end="02:56:13.170">You are afraid!</p>
<p begin="02:56:13.440" end="02:56:16.000">All your life, you have hidden in the shadows.</p>
<p begin="02:56:16.270" end="02:56:19.730">Scared of who you are, of what you are.</p>
<p begin="02:56:22.150" end="02:56:26.510">I will not lead the Ring within a hundred leagues of your city.</p>
<p begin="02:56:38.360" end="02:56:39.690">Frodo.</p>
<p begin="02:56:41.560" end="02:56:43.050">The Argonath.</p>
<p begin="02:56:46.540" end="02:56:50.270">Long have I desired to look upon the kings of old.</p>
<p begin="02:56:51.010" end="02:56:52.910">My kin.</p>
<p begin="02:58:11.960" end="02:58:14.150">We cross the lake at nightfall.</p>
<p begin="02:58:14.390" end="02:58:16.950">Hide the boats and continue on foot.</p>
<p begin="02:58:17.160" end="02:58:20.620">- We approach Mordor from the North. - Oh, yes?</p>
<p begin="02:58:20.960" end="02:58:24.800">Just a simple matter of finding our way through Emyn Muil...</p>
<p begin="02:58:24.970" end="02:58:28.230">...an impassable labyrinth of razor-sharp rocks.</p>
<p begin="02:58:28.440" end="02:58:31.500">And after that, it gets even better.</p>
<p begin="02:58:31.940" end="02:58:36.840">Festering, stinking marshland as far as the eye can see.</p>
<p begin="02:58:37.010" end="02:58:38.450">That is our road.</p>
<p begin="02:58:39.980" end="02:58:43.150">I suggest you take some rest and recover your strength, Master Dwarf.</p>
<p begin="02:58:43.390" end="02:58:45.120">Recover my--</p>
<p begin="02:58:48.120" end="02:58:50.090">- We should leave now. - No.</p>
<p begin="02:58:50.290" end="02:58:54.700">Orcs patrol the eastern shore. We must wait for cover of darkness.</p>
<p begin="02:58:54.930" end="02:58:58.390">It is not the eastern shore that worries me.</p>
<p begin="02:58:58.600" end="02:59:02.590">A shadow and a threat has been growing in my mind.</p>
<p begin="02:59:03.110" end="02:59:07.300">Something draws near. I can feel it.</p>
<p begin="02:59:09.280" end="02:59:14.220">Recover strength? Pay no heed to that, young Hobbit.</p>
<p begin="02:59:14.720" end="02:59:16.450">Where's Frodo?</p>
<p begin="02:59:42.080" end="02:59:44.010">None of us should wander alone.</p>
<p begin="02:59:45.380" end="02:59:47.510">You, least of all.</p>
<p begin="02:59:47.720" end="02:59:50.190">So much depends on you.</p>
<p begin="02:59:51.220" end="02:59:53.190">Frodo?</p>
<p begin="03:00:00.260" end="03:00:02.860">I know why you seek solitude.</p>
<p begin="03:00:03.570" end="03:00:07.000">You suffer. I see it day by day.</p>
<p begin="03:00:07.770" end="03:00:10.860">You sure you do not suffer needlessly?</p>
<p begin="03:00:12.510" end="03:00:15.170">There are other ways, Frodo.</p>
<p begin="03:00:15.380" end="03:00:19.210">- Other paths that we might take. - I know what you would say.</p>
<p begin="03:00:19.420" end="03:00:23.220">It would seem like wisdom but for the warning in my heart.</p>
<p begin="03:00:23.420" end="03:00:26.510">Warning? Against what?</p>
<p begin="03:00:26.720" end="03:00:28.850">We're all afraid, Frodo.</p>
<p begin="03:00:29.060" end="03:00:32.690">But to let that fear drive us, to destroy what hope we have...</p>
<p begin="03:00:32.900" end="03:00:36.700">- ...don't you see that is madness? - There is no other way.</p>
<p begin="03:00:38.430" end="03:00:41.770">I ask only for the strength to defend my people!</p>
<p begin="03:00:43.370" end="03:00:45.400">- If you would but lend me the Ring. - No.</p>
<p begin="03:00:46.640" end="03:00:50.310">- Why do you recoil? I am no thief. - You are not yourself.</p>
<p begin="03:00:52.120" end="03:00:55.450">What chance do you think you have?</p>
<p begin="03:00:55.650" end="03:01:00.320">They will find you. They will take the Ring.</p>
<p begin="03:01:00.560" end="03:01:04.250">And you will beg for death before the end!</p>
<p begin="03:01:06.400" end="03:01:08.450">You fool!</p>
<p begin="03:01:08.660" end="03:01:12.660">It is not yours, save by unhappy chance! It could have been mine.</p>
<p begin="03:01:12.840" end="03:01:15.670">It should be mine! Give it to me!</p>
<p begin="03:01:15.840" end="03:01:17.140">- Give it to me! - No!</p>
<p begin="03:01:17.310" end="03:01:19.140">- Give it to me! - No.</p>
<p begin="03:01:26.780" end="03:01:28.810">I see your mind.</p>
<p begin="03:01:29.050" end="03:01:31.990">You will take the Ring to Sauron!</p>
<p begin="03:01:32.190" end="03:01:34.090">You will betray us!</p>
<p begin="03:01:34.290" end="03:01:37.490">You'll go to your death, and the death of us all!</p>
<p begin="03:01:37.930" end="03:01:41.590">Curse you! Curse you and all the halflings!</p>
<p begin="03:01:48.640" end="03:01:50.160">Frodo?</p>
<p begin="03:01:54.480" end="03:01:56.070">Frodo.</p>
<p begin="03:01:59.980" end="03:02:02.010">What have I done?</p>
<p begin="03:02:02.220" end="03:02:03.950">Please, Frodo.</p>
<p begin="03:02:04.150" end="03:02:06.820">Frodo, I'm sorry!</p>
<p begin="03:02:55.400" end="03:02:56.840">Frodo?</p>
<p begin="03:02:58.070" end="03:03:01.170">- It has taken Boromir. - Where is the Ring?</p>
<p begin="03:03:01.380" end="03:03:03.170">Stay away!</p>
<p begin="03:03:03.580" end="03:03:05.170">Frodo!</p>
<p begin="03:03:07.420" end="03:03:11.250">- I swore to protect you. - Can you protect me from yourself?</p>
<p begin="03:03:20.930" end="03:03:23.420">Would you destroy it?</p>
<p begin="03:03:28.400" end="03:03:30.370">Aragorn.</p>
<p begin="03:03:33.780" end="03:03:36.110">Aragorn.</p>
<p begin="03:03:37.910" end="03:03:39.780">Elessar.</p>
<p begin="03:03:47.420" end="03:03:50.790">I would have gone with you to the end.</p>
<p begin="03:03:51.460" end="03:03:54.290">Into the very fires of Mordor.</p>
<p begin="03:03:57.630" end="03:03:58.790">I know.</p>
<p begin="03:04:01.270" end="03:04:06.730">Look after the others. Especially Sam. He will not understand.</p>
<p begin="03:04:10.480" end="03:04:12.210">Go, Frodo!</p>
<p begin="03:04:15.220" end="03:04:16.710">Run.</p>
<p begin="03:04:16.950" end="03:04:18.610">Run!</p>
<p begin="03:04:43.180" end="03:04:44.840">Mr. Frodo!</p>
<p begin="03:04:54.120" end="03:04:55.890">Find the halfling!</p>
<p begin="03:04:57.530" end="03:05:00.050">Find the halfling!</p>
<p begin="03:05:03.530" end="03:05:05.190">Elendil!</p>
<p begin="03:05:11.710" end="03:05:13.270">Aragorn, go!</p>

<p begin="03:05:36.870" end="03:05:38.490">Hide here. Quick!</p>
<p begin="03:05:39.100" end="03:05:40.570">Come on!</p>
<p begin="03:05:43.040" end="03:05:45.060">What's he doing?</p>
<p begin="03:05:49.310" end="03:05:51.300">He's leaving.</p>
<p begin="03:05:56.090" end="03:05:59.020">- No! - Pippin!</p>
<p begin="03:06:03.930" end="03:06:06.260">Run, Frodo. Go on!</p>
<p begin="03:06:06.830" end="03:06:09.920">- Hey! Hey, you! - Over here!</p>
<p begin="03:06:10.330" end="03:06:11.920">- Over here! - This way!</p>
<p begin="03:06:22.780" end="03:06:25.110">- It's working! - I know it's working! Run!</p>
<p begin="03:07:20.470" end="03:07:23.530">- The horn of Gondor. - Boromir.</p>
<p begin="03:08:06.650" end="03:08:07.740">Run!</p>
<p begin="03:11:39.360" end="03:11:40.950">No.</p>
<p begin="03:11:44.900" end="03:11:47.930">- They took the little ones. - Hold still.</p>
<p begin="03:11:48.200" end="03:11:50.230">Frodo. Where is Frodo?</p>
<p begin="03:11:52.110" end="03:11:53.570">I let Frodo go.</p>
<p begin="03:11:54.240" end="03:11:56.870">Then you did what I could not.</p>
<p begin="03:11:57.880" end="03:12:01.180">I tried to take the Ring from him.</p>
<p begin="03:12:01.720" end="03:12:05.950">- The Ring is beyond our reach now. - Forgive me.</p>
<p begin="03:12:06.190" end="03:12:08.450">I did not see it.</p>
<p begin="03:12:08.690" end="03:12:11.890">- I have failed you all. - No, Boromir.</p>
<p begin="03:12:12.290" end="03:12:14.820">You fought bravely.</p>
<p begin="03:12:15.130" end="03:12:17.790">You have kept your honor.</p>
<p begin="03:12:18.430" end="03:12:20.300">Leave it.</p>
<p begin="03:12:20.640" end="03:12:22.730">It is over.</p>
<p begin="03:12:23.940" end="03:12:29.140">The world of Men will fall. And all will come to darkness...</p>
<p begin="03:12:29.610" end="03:12:32.600">...and my city to ruin.</p>
<p begin="03:12:36.650" end="03:12:39.420">I do not know what strength is in my blood...</p>
<p begin="03:12:39.590" end="03:12:43.580">...but I swear to you, I will not let the White City fall...</p>
<p begin="03:12:44.590" end="03:12:47.080">...nor our people fail.</p>
<p begin="03:12:48.030" end="03:12:49.430">Our people.</p>
<p begin="03:12:53.270" end="03:12:55.330">Our people.</p>
<p begin="03:13:17.130" end="03:13:20.120">I would have followed you, my brother.</p>
<p begin="03:13:21.660" end="03:13:23.650">My captain.</p>
<p begin="03:13:26.300" end="03:13:28.200">My king.</p>
<p begin="03:13:47.860" end="03:13:50.090">Be at peace...</p>
<p begin="03:13:50.490" end="03:13:52.480">...son of Gondor.</p>
<p begin="03:14:08.940" end="03:14:12.310">They will look for his coming from the White Tower.</p>
<p begin="03:14:12.810" end="03:14:15.810">But he will not return.</p>
<p begin="03:14:39.040" end="03:14:41.030">Frodo!</p>
<p begin="03:15:00.460" end="03:15:03.760">I wish the Ring had never come to me.</p>
<p begin="03:15:05.000" end="03:15:07.990">I wish none of this had happened.</p>
<p begin="03:15:10.970" end="03:15:13.770">So do all who live to see such times...</p>
<p begin="03:15:13.940" end="03:15:17.430">...but that is not for them to decide.</p>
<p begin="03:15:17.610" end="03:15:20.240">All you have to decide...</p>
<p begin="03:15:20.450" end="03:15:25.180">...is what to do with the time that is given to you.</p>
<p begin="03:15:54.020" end="03:15:56.110">Frodo, no!</p>
<p begin="03:15:56.650" end="03:15:57.950">Frodo!</p>
<p begin="03:15:58.720" end="03:16:01.420">- Mr. Frodo! - No, Sam.</p>
<p begin="03:16:04.960" end="03:16:06.930">Go back, Sam!</p>
<p begin="03:16:07.430" end="03:16:10.990">- I'm going to Mordor alone. - Of course you are.</p>
<p begin="03:16:11.200" end="03:16:14.030">And I'm coming with you!</p>
<p begin="03:16:14.540" end="03:16:16.970">You can't swim!</p>
<p begin="03:16:20.740" end="03:16:22.470">Sam!</p>
<p begin="03:16:28.050" end="03:16:29.380">Sam!</p>
<p begin="03:17:10.290" end="03:17:13.020">I made a promise, Mr. Frodo.</p>
<p begin="03:17:13.360" end="03:17:17.700">A promise: "Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."</p>
<p begin="03:17:18.800" end="03:17:21.430">And I don't mean to.</p>
<p begin="03:17:21.700" end="03:17:23.860">I don't mean to.</p>
<p begin="03:17:25.540" end="03:17:27.370">Sam.</p>
<p begin="03:17:42.260" end="03:17:43.920">Come on.</p>
<p begin="03:18:12.350" end="03:18:16.920">Hurry! Frodo and Sam have reached the eastern shore.</p>
<p begin="03:18:31.810" end="03:18:36.800">- You mean not to follow them. - Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.</p>
<p begin="03:18:40.220" end="03:18:45.120">Then it has all been in vain. The Fellowship has failed.</p>
<p begin="03:18:56.970" end="03:19:00.130">Not if we hold true to each other.</p>
<p begin="03:19:01.500" end="03:19:05.960">We will not abandon Merry and Pippin to torment and death.</p>
<p begin="03:19:06.980" end="03:19:12.210">Not while we have strength left. Leave all that can be spared behind.</p>
<p begin="03:19:13.520" end="03:19:15.540">We travel light.</p>
<p begin="03:19:15.720" end="03:19:17.650">Let us hunt some Orc.</p>
<p begin="03:19:20.620" end="03:19:22.650">Yes!</p>
<p begin="03:19:41.640" end="03:19:43.080">Mordor.</p>
<p begin="03:19:43.710" end="03:19:47.080">I hope the others find a safer road.</p>
<p begin="03:19:48.020" end="03:19:50.580">Strider will look after them.</p>
<p begin="03:19:51.520" end="03:19:54.890">I don't suppose we'll ever see them again.</p>
<p begin="03:19:55.220" end="03:19:57.660">We may yet, Mr. Frodo.</p>
<p begin="03:19:57.860" end="03:19:59.420">We may.</p>
<p begin="03:20:01.460" end="03:20:02.560">Sam...</p>
<p begin="03:20:06.170" end="03:20:08.760">...I'm glad you are with me.</p>

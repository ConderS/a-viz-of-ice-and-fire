<p begin="00:00:53.100" end="00:00:55.900">I don't know about you,<br />it's just too hot today, isn't it?</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.900" end="00:01:00.400">And it's going to get even worse.<br />Temperatures up in the mid-30s Celsius...</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.400" end="00:01:04.100">...that's the mid-90s Fahrenheit,<br />tomorrow, maybe even hitting 100.</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.200" end="00:01:06.900">So, please, remember to cover up<br />and stay cool...</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.100" end="00:01:09.900">...with the hottest hits<br />on your FM dial.</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.100" end="00:01:12.800">Come on, guys,<br />time to go home.</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.600" end="00:01:15.700">Come on, love, off you get.</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.600" end="00:01:21.100">- Do we have to?<br />- Yes, we do.</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.700" end="00:01:24.900">I'll make you your favorite<br />dinner to compensate.</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.000" end="00:01:31.300">He squealed like a pig, didn't he?<br />Yeah, brilliant punch, Big D.<br />Did you see his face?</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.500" end="00:01:33.400">Hey, Big D.</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.300" end="00:01:38.600">Beat up another 10-year-old?<br />- This one deserved it.<br />- Yeah.</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.100" end="00:01:43.400">- Five against one, very brave.<br />- Well, you're one to talk.</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.500" end="00:01:48.800">Moaning in your sleep every night?<br />At least I'm not afraid of my pillow.</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.000" end="00:01:53.800">"Don't kill Cedric. "</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.200" end="00:01:56.400">Who's Cedric, your boyfriend?</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.300" end="00:02:01.200">- Shut up.<br />- "He's going to kill me, Mum"</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.700" end="00:02:03.900">Where is your mum?</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.700" end="00:02:07.400">Where is your mum, Potter?</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.800" end="00:02:09.600">She dead?</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.800" end="00:02:12.400">Is she dead?</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.900" end="00:02:14.800">Is she a dead Pott...?</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.500" end="00:02:30.700">- Dudley.<br />- Dudley, let's go.</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.200" end="00:02:35.000">- What's going on?<br />- What are you doing?</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.200" end="00:02:40.400">- I'm not doing anything.<br />- We're getting out of here, Dudley.<br />Come on, Dudley, hurry up.</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.200" end="00:03:32.100">Dudley, run.</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.800" end="00:04:09.400">Expecto Patronum.</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.100" end="00:04:40.800">Mrs. Figg.</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.800" end="00:04:49.500">Don't put away your wand, Harry.<br />They might come back.</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.800" end="00:04:53.800">Dementors in Little Whinging,<br />whatever next?</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.900" end="00:04:57.900">- Whole world's gone topsy-turvy.<br />- I don't understand. How do you know...?</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.000" end="00:05:00.200">Dumbledore asked me<br />to keep an eye on you.</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.400" end="00:05:03.800">Dumbledore asked you?<br />You know Dumbledore?</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.000" end="00:05:07.800">After You-Know-Who<br />killed that poor Diggory boy last year...</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.000" end="00:05:10.600">...did you expect him to let you<br />go wandering on your own?</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.800" end="00:05:16.800">Good Lord, boy.<br />They told me you were intelligent.<br />Now, get inside and stay there.</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.000" end="00:05:21.700">Expect someone will be in touch soon.<br />Whatever happens, don't leave the house.</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.000" end="00:05:35.700">It is hot. That's right, hot everywhere.<br />There's sweat. There's stifling.</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.900" end="00:05:37.800">Diddykins?</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.100" end="00:05:40.100">Is that you?</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.300" end="00:05:46.500">Duddy. Vernon, come quick.</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.200" end="00:05:52.000">We're going to have to<br />take him to a hospital.<br />Who did this to you, boy?</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.400" end="00:05:58.200">Happy, are we, now?</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.500" end="00:06:05.100">You've finally done it.<br />You've finally driven him loopy.<br />Vernon, don't say that.</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.300" end="00:06:09.700">Well, just look at him, Petunia.<br />Our boy has gone yumpy.</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.000" end="00:06:12.000">I've reached my limit, do you hear?</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.200" end="00:06:16.000">This is the last I'm gonna take<br />of you and your nonsense.</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.900" end="00:06:32.000">- Dear Mr. Potter.<br />- What?</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.200" end="00:06:37.400">The Ministry has received intelligence<br />that at 6:23 this evening...</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.600" end="00:06:42.300">...you performed the Patronus Charm<br />in the presence of a Muggle.</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.600" end="00:06:44.600">As a clear violation...</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.800" end="00:06:48.800">...of the Decree for the Reasonable<br />Restriction of Underage Sorcery...</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.000" end="00:06:51.200">...you are hereby expelled...</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.600" end="00:06:55.000">...from Hogwarts School<br />of Witchcraft and Wizardry.</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.700" end="00:07:00.200">Hoping you are well,<br />Mafalda Hopkirk.</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.300" end="00:07:06.600">Justice.</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.900" end="00:07:21.100">He's not very well.</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.600" end="00:07:35.400">Sorry, Hedwig.</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.600" end="00:08:44.700">Very clean, these Muggles.</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.800" end="00:08:47.600">- Tonks, for God's sake.<br />- Unnatural.</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.600" end="00:08:53.200">Professor Moody.</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.600" end="00:08:57.000">- What are you doing here?<br />- Rescuing you, of course.</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.500" end="00:09:02.200">But where are we going?<br />The letter said I've been expelled.</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.400" end="00:09:06.000">You haven't been. Not yet.<br />Kingsley, you take point.<br />But the letter said...</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.200" end="00:09:09.200">Dumbledore persuaded the minister<br />to suspend your expulsion...</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.400" end="00:09:11.500">...pending a formal hearing.<br />- A hearing?</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.700" end="00:09:15.100">Don't worry. We'll explain everything<br />when we get back to headquarters.</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.300" end="00:09:17.600">Not here, Nymphadora.</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.700" end="00:09:21.600">Don't call me Nymphadora.</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.900" end="00:09:31.200">Stay in formation, everyone.<br />Don't break ranks if one of us is killed.</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.800" end="00:10:23.200">Come on, you, around the corner.</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.900" end="00:10:26.400">Come on.</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.800" end="00:11:07.600">In you go, son.</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.100" end="00:11:12.500">There've been no sightings.<br />No deaths. No proof.</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.700" end="00:11:15.500">He almost killed Harry.<br />If that isn't proof enough...</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.700" end="00:11:19.600">Yes, but guarding you-know-what<br />is the most important...</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.900" end="00:11:24.300">We must trust Dumbledore on this.</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.500" end="00:11:28.900">Was he able to protect Harry last year?<br />Well, tonight I say it's time to take action.</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.100" end="00:11:32.300">Cornelius Fudge is a politician<br />first and a wizard second.</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.500" end="00:11:35.600">- His instinct would be to ignore it...<br />- Keep your voices down.</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.800" end="00:11:40.200">He's getting stronger and stronger<br />by the minute. We have to act now.</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.200" end="00:11:46.500">- Harry.<br />- Mrs. Weasley.</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.100" end="00:11:51.600">Heavens, you're all right.</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.100" end="00:11:58.900">Bit peaky, but I'm afraid dinner will wait<br />until after the meeting's finished.</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.100" end="00:12:04.200">Nope. No time to explain.<br />Straight upstairs, first door on the left.</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.600" end="00:12:06.000">Yeah.</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.300" end="00:12:13.500">Mudblood, werewolves, traitors, thieves.</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.600" end="00:12:18.500">If my poor mistress<br />knew the scum they let into her house...</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.700" end="00:12:21.400">...what would she<br />say to old Kreacher?</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.000" end="00:12:25.000">Oh, the shame.</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.400" end="00:12:40.100">- Freaks.<br />- There, there, mistress.</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.300" end="00:12:46.500">Scum of the earth.<br />Not like it was in the days of my fathers.<br />Kreacher is here.</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.600" end="00:12:52.000">Oh, Harry.</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.800" end="00:12:58.600">Are you all right? We overheard them<br />talking about the Dementor attack.</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.800" end="00:13:01.600">- You must tell us everything.<br />- Let the man breathe, Hermione.</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.800" end="00:13:06.000">And this hearing at the Ministry.<br />It's just outrageous.</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.200" end="00:13:08.300">I've looked it up.<br />They simply can't expel you.</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.500" end="00:13:11.200">- It's completely unfair.<br />- Yeah.</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.700" end="00:13:14.900">There's a lot of that<br />going round at the moment.</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.300" end="00:13:18.200">So, what is this place?</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.400" end="00:13:21.700">- It's headquarters.<br />- Of the Order of the Phoenix.</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.900" end="00:13:26.100">It's a secret society.<br />Dumbledore formed it back when<br />they fought You-Know-Who.</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.300" end="00:13:28.800">Couldn't have put any of this<br />in a letter, I suppose?</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.500" end="00:13:31.700">I've gone all summer<br />without a scrap of news.</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.300" end="00:13:35.900">We wanted to write, mate.<br />Really, we did.</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.100" end="00:13:37.100">- Only...<br />- Only what?</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.300" end="00:13:40.800">Only Dumbledore made us swear<br />not to tell you anything.</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.300" end="00:13:44.100">Dumbledore said that?</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.800" end="00:13:48.600">But why would he keep me in the dark?<br />Maybe I could help.</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.700" end="00:13:50.700">I'm the one who<br />saw Voldemort return...</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.900" end="00:13:53.700">...the one who fought him,<br />who saw Cedric Diggory get killed.</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.900" end="00:13:56.100">- Harry.<br />- Thought we heard your dulcet tones.</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.200" end="00:14:00.300">- Don't bottle it up, though, mate. Let it out.<br />- Lf you're all done shouting...</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.500" end="00:14:04.000">Do you wanna hear something<br />a little more interesting?</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.300" end="00:14:07.600">If anyone has a right to know, it's Harry.<br />If it wasn't for Harry...</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.800" end="00:14:11.600">...we wouldn't even know<br />Voldemort was back.<br />He's not a child, Molly.</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.800" end="00:14:14.100">But he's not an adult either.</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.400" end="00:14:19.700">- He's not James, Sirius.<br />- Well, he's not your son.<br />He's as good as.</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.100" end="00:14:21.800">- Who else has he got?<br />- Hey, Ginny.</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.900" end="00:14:24.400">- He's got me.<br />- How touchingly paternal, Black.</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.500" end="00:14:27.600">Perhaps Potter will grow up to<br />be a felon, just like his godfather.</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.800" end="00:14:31.800">Now, you stay out of this, Snivellus.<br />- Snape's part of the Order?<br />- Git.</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.000" end="00:14:36.700">About your supposed reformation.<br />- I know better.<br />- So why don't you tell him?</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.900" end="00:14:38.800">- Get off it.<br />- Quick.</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.800" end="00:14:40.400">- Get it up.<br />- Crookshanks.</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.800" end="00:14:43.000">- Stop it.<br />- Get off, you bloody cat.</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.100" end="00:14:46.000">- Crookshanks. Leave it alone.<br />- Get it up.</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.400" end="00:14:51.000">- Hermione, I hate your cat.<br />- Bad Crookshanks.</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.300" end="00:14:55.200">Well, we'll be eating<br />down in the kitchen.</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.900" end="00:14:58.200">Just because you're allowed<br />to use magic now...</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.400" end="00:15:03.200">...does not mean you have to<br />whip your wands out for everything.<br />Hi, Mum.</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.200" end="00:15:05.900">You hungry, Harry?</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.100" end="00:15:11.000">You sure you're all right, Harry?<br />Gave us quite a turn.<br />Harry Potter.</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.200" end="00:15:15.000">Sirius.</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.800" end="00:15:23.100">This is very, very peculiar.</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.200" end="00:15:26.900">It seems your hearing in the Ministry<br />is to be before the entire Wizengamot.</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.100" end="00:15:31.200">I don't understand. What has<br />the Ministry of Magic got against me?</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.400" end="00:15:34.800">Show him. He'll find out soon enough.</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.200" end="00:15:48.200">He's been attacking Dumbledore as well.</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.100" end="00:15:55.100">Fudge is using all his power, including<br />his influence at the Daily Prophet...</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.400" end="00:15:59.900">...to smear anyone who claims<br />the Dark Lord has returned.<br />Why?</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.000" end="00:16:04.300">He thinks Dumbledore's after his job.<br />No one in their right mind<br />could believe that...</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.500" end="00:16:10.000">Exactly the point.<br />Fudge isn't in his right mind.<br />It's been twisted and warped by fear.</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.700" end="00:16:14.100">Now, fear makes people<br />do terrible things, Harry.</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.300" end="00:16:16.700">The last time<br />Voldemort gained power...</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.900" end="00:16:20.300">...he almost destroyed<br />everything we hold most dear.</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.400" end="00:16:24.300">Now he's returned, and I'm afraid<br />the minister will do almost anything...</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.500" end="00:16:27.500">...to avoid facing that terrifying truth.</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.700" end="00:16:33.400">We think Voldemort<br />wants to build up his army again.</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.500" end="00:16:37.200">Fourteen years ago,<br />he had huge numbers at his command.</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.400" end="00:16:41.900">And not just witches and wizards,<br />but all manner of dark creatures.</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.500" end="00:16:46.800">He's been recruiting heavily, and<br />we've been attempting to do the same.</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.500" end="00:16:51.500">But gathering followers<br />isn't the only thing he's interested in.</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.200" end="00:16:56.000">We believe...</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.000" end="00:17:00.200">...Voldemort may be after something.<br />Sirius.</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.900" end="00:17:06.800">Something he didn't have last time.</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.200" end="00:17:10.300">You mean like a weapon?</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.400" end="00:17:14.500">No. That's enough. He's just a boy.</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.700" end="00:17:17.500">You say more and you might as well<br />induct him into the Order.</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.600" end="00:17:22.100">Good. I want to join. If Voldemort's<br />raising an army, then I want to fight.</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.900" end="00:17:35.800">Harry.</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.000" end="00:17:38.200">You are hereby expelled.</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.400" end="00:17:41.200">Before the entire Wizengamot.</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.500" end="00:17:52.300">Trains. Underground.</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.500" end="00:17:54.800">Ingenious, these Muggles.</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.000" end="00:18:13.800">Here we are.</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.600" end="00:18:20.100">I've never used the visitors' entrance<br />before. Should be fun.</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.800" end="00:18:25.100">Right. Good.<br />I'll just get my Muggle money.</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.100" end="00:19:08.000">Terrible. Lost a lot of Galleons<br />trading on the potions market.</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.200" end="00:19:11.500">Daily Prophet, ladies and gentlemen.<br />Anybody for Daily Prophet?</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.700" end="00:19:14.600">Dumbledore: Is he daft,<br />or is he dangerous?</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.600" end="00:19:39.400">- Morning, Arthur.<br />- Morning, Bob.</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.000" end="00:19:47.700">Interdepartmental memos.<br />We used to use owls.<br />Mess was unbelievable.</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.900" end="00:19:56.300">Merlin's beard.<br />Thank you, Kingsley.</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.500" end="00:20:00.100">- They've changed the time of your hearing.<br />- When is it?</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.300" end="00:20:02.100">In five minutes.</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.800" end="00:20:13.000">Department of Mysteries.</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.600" end="00:20:19.700">And I'm confident, minister,<br />that you will do the right thing.</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.900" end="00:20:22.000">Yes, but we must be...</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.100" end="00:20:32.600">Remember, during the hearing,<br />speak only when you're spoken to.</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.700" end="00:20:36.300">Keep calm. You've done nothing wrong.</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.600" end="00:20:39.800">As the Muggles say, truth will out.</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.300" end="00:20:41.700">Yes?</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.900" end="00:20:45.200">I'm not allowed in, I'm afraid.</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.800" end="00:20:48.600">Good luck, Harry.</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.500" end="00:20:55.000">Disciplinary hearing<br />of the 12th of August...</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.200" end="00:20:58.200">...into offenses committed<br />by Harry James Potter...</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.300" end="00:21:02.000">...resident at Number 4 Privet Drive,<br />Little Whinging, Surrey.</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.100" end="00:21:07.200">Interrogators: Cornelius Oswald Fudge,<br />Minister of Mag...<br />Witness for the defense.</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.400" end="00:21:10.600">Albus Percival Wulfric...</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.900" end="00:21:14.300">...Brian Dumbledore.</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.600" end="00:21:17.900">You got our message<br />that the time and place of the hearing...</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.000" end="00:21:20.600">...had been changed, did you?<br />- I must have missed it.</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.800" end="00:21:25.000">But by a happy mistake,<br />I arrived at the Ministry three hours early.</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.700" end="00:21:29.100">The charges?</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.100" end="00:21:33.500">The charges against the accused<br />are as follows:<br />"That he did knowingly...</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.600" end="00:21:40.300">...and in full awareness<br />of the illegality of his actions...<br />...produce a Patronus Charm...</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.500" end="00:21:43.700">...in the presence of a Muggle. "</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.900" end="00:21:47.200">- Do you deny producing said Patronus?<br />- No, but...</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.300" end="00:21:50.800">And you were aware that you were<br />forbidden to use magic outside school...</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.000" end="00:21:57.400">...while under the age of 17?<br />- Yes, I was, but...<br />Witches and wizards of the Wizengamot...</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.500" end="00:22:00.500">I was only doing it<br />because of the Dementors.</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.500" end="00:22:04.100">Dementors?</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.700" end="00:22:06.400">In Little Whinging?</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.500" end="00:22:08.900">That's quite clever.</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.000" end="00:22:12.200">Muggles can't see Dementors,<br />can they, boy?</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.400" end="00:22:14.600">- Highly convenient.<br />- I'm not lying.</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.700" end="00:22:17.300">- There were two of them, and if I hadn't...<br />- Enough.</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.500" end="00:22:21.700">I'm sorry to interrupt what I'm sure would<br />have been a very well-rehearsed story...</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.800" end="00:22:26.300">...but since you can produce<br />no witnesses of the event...</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.500" end="00:22:31.100">Pardon me, minister,<br />but as it happens, we can.</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.500" end="00:22:37.500">Please describe the attack.</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.300" end="00:22:42.300">What did they look like?</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.700" end="00:22:48.100">Well, one of them was very large<br />and the other rather skinny.</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.200" end="00:22:52.000">Not the boys. The Dementors.</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.200" end="00:22:55.900">Oh, right, right. Well, big.</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.100" end="00:23:01.700">Cloaked. Then everything went cold...</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.300" end="00:23:05.800">...as though all the happiness<br />had gone from the world.</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.900" end="00:23:11.000">Now, look here. Dementors don't just<br />wander into a Muggle suburb...</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.200" end="00:23:14.800">...and happen across a wizard.<br />The odds are astronomical.</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.000" end="00:23:20.300">I don't think anyone would believe...<br />...the Dementors were there<br />by coincidence, minister.</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.400" end="00:23:25.300">I'm sure I must have misunderstood you,<br />professor.</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.500" end="00:23:31.000">Dementors are, after all,<br />under the control of the Ministry of Magic.</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.100" end="00:23:35.300">And it's so silly of me,<br />but it sounded for a moment as though...</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.500" end="00:23:39.500">...you were suggesting that the Ministry<br />had ordered the attack on this boy.</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.700" end="00:23:42.500">That would be disturbing indeed,<br />Madam Undersecretary...</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.700" end="00:23:46.800">...which is why I'm sure the Ministry<br />will be mounting a full-scale inquiry...</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.000" end="00:23:50.400">...into why the two Dementors<br />were so very far from Azkaban...</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.500" end="00:23:54.100">...and why they mounted an attack<br />without authorization.</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.800" end="00:23:57.100">Of course, there is someone...</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.300" end="00:23:59.900">...who might be behind the attack.</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.900" end="00:24:07.600">Cornelius, I implore you to see reason.</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.700" end="00:24:12.300">The evidence that the Dark Lord<br />has returned is incontrovertible.</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.500" end="00:24:15.200">He is not back.</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.200" end="00:24:23.600">In the matter of Harry Potter...</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.900" end="00:24:26.400">...the law clearly states...</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.600" end="00:24:31.000">...that magic may be used before Muggles<br />in life-threatening situations.</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.200" end="00:24:34.200">Laws can be changed if necessary,<br />Dumbledore.</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.200" end="00:24:37.400">Clearly. Has it become practice<br />to hold a full criminal trial...</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.600" end="00:24:40.900">...to deal with a simple matter<br />of underage magic?</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.900" end="00:24:52.400">Those in favor of conviction?</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.200" end="00:25:06.200">Those in favor<br />of clearing the accused of all charges?</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.300" end="00:25:22.500">Cleared of all charges.</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.600" end="00:25:27.300">Professor.</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.300" end="00:25:43.300">Padfoot. Are you barking mad?</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.500" end="00:25:45.900">You'll blow the entire operation.</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.300" end="00:25:59.700">Sirius, what are you doing here?<br />If somebody sees you...<br />I had to see you off, didn't I?</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.500" end="00:26:04.000">What's life without a little risk?</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.200" end="00:26:08.600">I don't wanna see you<br />get chucked back in Azkaban.<br />Don't worry about me.</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.600" end="00:26:13.600">Anyway, I wanted you to have this.</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.000" end="00:26:22.000">Original Order of the Phoenix.</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.500" end="00:26:24.300">Marlene McKinnon.</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.400" end="00:26:30.500">She was killed<br />two weeks after this was taken.<br />Voldemort wiped out her entire family.</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.000" end="00:26:34.400">Frank and Alice Longbottom.<br />Neville's parents.</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.600" end="00:26:38.300">They suffered a fate worse than death,<br />you ask me.</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.200" end="00:26:42.700">It's been 14 years.</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.500" end="00:26:47.700">And still a day doesn't go by<br />I don't miss your dad.</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.400" end="00:26:55.900">Do you really think<br />there's going to be a war, Sirius?</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.700" end="00:27:00.800">It feels like it did before.</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.000" end="00:27:06.800">You keep it.</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.300" end="00:27:11.700">Anyway, I suppose<br />you're the young ones now.</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.900" end="00:27:17.900">I'll see you at the train.<br />Bye-bye, darling.</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.800" end="00:27:20.300">I love you.</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.100" end="00:27:23.100">Hold my hand, lovey.</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.300" end="00:27:27.100">There they are.<br />They're in the far carriage.<br />Bye.</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.300" end="00:28:12.200">I'm surprised the Ministry's<br />still letting you walk around free.</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.400" end="00:28:17.500">Better enjoy it while you can.<br />I expect there's a cell in Azkaban<br />with your name on it.</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.900" end="00:28:23.900">- What'd I tell you? Complete nutter.<br />- Just stay away from me!</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.100" end="00:28:26.900">It's only Malfoy.</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.800" end="00:28:29.600">What'd you expect?</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.600" end="00:28:50.800">Hi, guys.</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.900" end="00:28:53.500">- Hey, Neville.<br />- Hey there, Neville.</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.600" end="00:29:07.200">What is it?</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.300" end="00:29:12.600">- What's what?<br />- That. Pulling the carriage.</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.500" end="00:29:16.200">Nothing's pulling the carriage, Harry.</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.400" end="00:29:18.800">It's pulling itself, like always.</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.200" end="00:29:34.500">You're not going mad.</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.000" end="00:29:39.300">I can see them too.</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.500" end="00:29:43.100">You're just as sane as I am.</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.000" end="00:29:50.300">Everyone, this is Loony Love...</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.800" end="00:29:54.700">Luna Lovegood.</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.700" end="00:30:01.000">What an interesting necklace.</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.500" end="00:30:03.700">It's a charm, actually.</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.100" end="00:30:07.000">Keeps away the Nargles.</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.400" end="00:30:11.900">Hungry.</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.600" end="00:30:14.600">I hope there's pudding.</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.600" end="00:30:19.200">- What's a Nargle?<br />- No idea.</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.900" end="00:30:33.800">Good evening, children.</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.800" end="00:30:37.500">Now, we have two changes<br />in staffing this year.</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.700" end="00:30:40.700">We're pleased to welcome back<br />Professor Grubbly-Plank...</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.900" end="00:30:43.500">...who'll be taking<br />Care of Magical Creatures...</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.600" end="00:30:47.100">...while Professor Hagrid<br />is on temporary leave.</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.900" end="00:30:51.900">We also wish to welcome our new<br />Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher...</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.100" end="00:30:55.300">...Professor Dolores Umbridge.</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.600" end="00:30:59.700">And I'm sure you'll all join me<br />in wishing the professor good luck.</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.100" end="00:31:05.100">Now, as usual, our caretaker, Mr. Filch,<br />has asked me to remind you...</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.200" end="00:31:19.100">She was at my hearing.<br />She works for Fudge.</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.100" end="00:31:24.800">Thank you, headmaster,<br />for those kind words of welcome.</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.200" end="00:31:29.800">And how lovely to see all your bright...</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.000" end="00:31:32.900">...happy faces smiling up at me.</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.200" end="00:31:38.400">I'm sure we're all going<br />to be very good friends.</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.600" end="00:31:41.000">- That's likely.<br />- That's likely.</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.700" end="00:31:46.800">The Ministry of Magic<br />has always considered...</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.800" end="00:31:52.400">...the education of young witches<br />and wizards to be of vital importance.</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.800" end="00:31:55.000">Although each headmaster...</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.200" end="00:32:00.000">...has brought something new<br />to this historic school...</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.600" end="00:32:07.800">...progress for the sake of progress<br />must be discouraged.</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.500" end="00:32:12.300">Let us preserve<br />what must be preserved...</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.500" end="00:32:16.000">...perfect what can be perfected...</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.200" end="00:32:22.800">...and prune practices<br />that ought to be prohibited.</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.800" end="00:32:33.900">Thank you, Professor Umbridge.<br />That really was most illuminating.</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.100" end="00:32:38.500">- Llluminating? What a load of waffle.<br />- What's it mean?</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.200" end="00:32:45.100">Magic is forbidden in the corridors...<br />It means the Ministry's<br />interfering at Hogwarts.</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.900" end="00:33:06.600">Dean, Seamus.</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.000" end="00:33:09.200">- Good holiday?<br />- All right.</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.500" end="00:33:11.700">Better than Seamus', anyway.</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.000" end="00:33:15.300">Me mum didn't want me<br />to come back this year.</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.500" end="00:33:18.800">- Why not?<br />- Let me see. Because of you.</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.200" end="00:33:22.600">The Daily Prophet's been saying<br />a lot of things about you and Dumbledore.</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.800" end="00:33:26.200">What, your mum believes them?<br />Nobody was there the night Cedric died.</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.300" end="00:33:29.400">I guess you should read the Prophet, then,<br />like your stupid mother.</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.600" end="00:33:33.100">- Don't talk about my mother.<br />- I'll have a go at anyone that calls me a liar.</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.300" end="00:33:35.800">- What's going on?<br />- He's mad, is what's going on.</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.900" end="00:33:40.800">Do you believe the rubbish he's come out<br />with about You-Know-Who?<br />Yeah. I do.</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.900" end="00:33:44.700">Has anyone else<br />got a problem with Harry?</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.300" end="00:33:55.700">- You all right?<br />- Fine.</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.800" end="00:33:58.600">Seamus was bang out of order, mate.</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.200" end="00:34:03.100">- But he'll come through, you'll see.<br />- I said, I'm fine, Ron.</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.600" end="00:34:11.000">Right. I'll just leave you<br />to your thoughts, then.</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.500" end="00:34:40.600">Harry.</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.000" end="00:34:58.300">Bring it over here. Over here.</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.000" end="00:35:01.900">Oh, go on, Seamus. Go on, get it.</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.500" end="00:35:19.400">Good morning, children.</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.000" end="00:35:26.100">Ordinary Wizarding Level examinations.</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.300" end="00:35:28.900">O- W-Ls.</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.100" end="00:35:33.600">More commonly known as OWLs.</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.800" end="00:35:36.900">Study hard and you will be rewarded.</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.300" end="00:35:42.500">Fail to do so,<br />and the consequences may be severe.</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.100" end="00:35:53.200">Your previous instruction in this subject<br />has been disturbingly uneven.</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.400" end="00:35:55.500">But you'll be pleased to know,<br />from now on...</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.700" end="00:35:59.100">...you will be following<br />a carefully structured, Ministry-approved...</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.300" end="00:36:02.000">...course of defensive magic. Yes?</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.400" end="00:36:07.700">There's nothing in here<br />about using defensive spells?<br />Using spells?</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.800" end="00:36:12.100">Well, I can't imagine why you would<br />need to use spells in my classroom.</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.000" end="00:36:14.600">We're not gonna use magic?</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.800" end="00:36:19.800">You'll be learning about defensive spells<br />in a secure, risk-free way.</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.900" end="00:36:22.700">What use is that?<br />If we're attacked, it won't be risk-free.</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.900" end="00:36:26.700">Students will raise their hands<br />when they speak in my class.</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.500" end="00:36:31.900">It is the view of the Ministry...</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.000" end="00:36:34.800">...that a theoretical knowledge<br />will be sufficient...</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.000" end="00:36:36.900">...to get you through your examinations...</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.100" end="00:36:39.500">...which, after all,<br />is what school is all about.</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.700" end="00:36:42.500">And how's theory supposed to prepare us<br />for what's out there?</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.700" end="00:36:44.700">There is nothing out there, dear.</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.900" end="00:36:47.900">Who do you imagine<br />wants to attack children like yourself?</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.100" end="00:36:51.300">Oh, I don't know.<br />Maybe Lord Voldemort.</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.000" end="00:37:06.500">Now, let me make this quite plain.</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.100" end="00:37:14.100">You have been told...<br />...that a certain dark wizard<br />is at large once again.</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.200" end="00:37:19.400">- This is a lie.<br />- It's not a lie. I saw him. I fought him.</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.500" end="00:37:23.700">Detention, Mr. Potter.<br />Cedric Diggory dropped dead<br />of his own accord?</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.700" end="00:37:28.600">Cedric Diggory's death<br />was a tragic accident.<br />It was murder. Voldemort killed him.</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.600" end="00:37:30.100">Enough!</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.700" end="00:37:32.400">Enough.</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.600" end="00:37:36.900">See me later, Mr. Potter. My office.</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.700" end="00:38:02.900">Come in.</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.100" end="00:38:10.100">Good evening, Mr. Potter.</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.700" end="00:38:12.000">Sit.</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.700" end="00:38:23.600">You're going to be doing some lines<br />for me today, Mr. Potter.</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.700" end="00:38:25.700">No, not with your quill.</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.800" end="00:38:29.000">Going to be using<br />a rather special one of mine.</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.200" end="00:38:35.600">Now...</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.500" end="00:38:42.400">...I want you to write,<br />"I must not tell lies. "</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.500" end="00:38:46.400">How many times?</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.800" end="00:38:51.500">Well, let's say for as long as it takes<br />for the message to sink in.</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.500" end="00:38:57.100">You haven't given me any ink.<br />Oh, you won't need any ink.</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.100" end="00:39:49.600">Yes?</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.900" end="00:40:00.300">- Nothing.<br />- That's right.</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.200" end="00:40:05.200">Because you know, deep down...</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.300" end="00:40:07.600">...you deserve to be punished.</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.600" end="00:40:10.700">Don't you, Mr. Potter?</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.000" end="00:40:16.600">Go on.</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.600" end="00:40:29.700">- Skiving Snackboxes.<br />- Sweets that make you ill.<br />Get out of class whenever you like.</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.900" end="00:40:33.600">Obtain hours of pleasure<br />from unprofitable boredom.</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.600" end="00:40:38.700">Care for another?<br />- I'm not asking you to write all of it for me.<br />- Please.</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.800" end="00:40:42.100">I've been busy studying<br />for these stupid OWL exams.</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.300" end="00:40:44.100">I'll do the introduction. That's all.</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.200" end="00:40:48.000">Hermione, you're honestly<br />the most wonderful person I've ever met.</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.200" end="00:40:52.900">- And if I'm ever rude to you again...<br />- I'll know you've gone back to normal.</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.500" end="00:40:59.700">What's wrong with your hand?</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.100" end="00:41:01.600">Nothing.</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.800" end="00:41:04.700">The other hand.</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.200" end="00:41:09.100">- You've got to tell Dumbledore.<br />- No.</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.200" end="00:41:11.400">Dumbledore's got enough<br />on his mind right now.</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.600" end="00:41:13.700">I don't want to give<br />Umbridge the satisfaction.</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.900" end="00:41:16.300">Bloody hell, Harry.<br />The woman's torturing you.</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.500" end="00:41:21.200">- If the parents knew about this...<br />- I haven't got any of those, have I, Ron?</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.200" end="00:41:25.700">Harry, you've got to report this.</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.900" end="00:41:29.500">- It's perfectly simple. You're being...<br />- No, it's not.</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.600" end="00:41:32.600">Hermione, whatever this is,<br />it's not simple.</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.500" end="00:41:35.500">You don't understand.</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.100" end="00:41:40.000">Then help us to.</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.700" end="00:41:56.600">Dear Padfoot...</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.100" end="00:41:58.900">...I hope you're all right.</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.100" end="00:42:03.600">It's starting to get colder here.<br />Winter is definitely on the way.</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.300" end="00:42:11.000">In spite of being back at Hogwarts,<br />I feel more alone than ever.</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.900" end="00:42:15.200">I know you, of all people,<br />will understand.</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.300" end="00:42:51.500">Hello, Harry Potter.</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.100" end="00:42:58.800">- Your feet. Aren ' t they cold?<br />- Bit.</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.700" end="00:43:03.700">Unfortunately, all my shoes<br />have mysteriously disappeared.</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.300" end="00:43:07.300">I suspect Nargles are behind it.</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.700" end="00:43:17.300">- What are they?<br />- They're called Thestrals.</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.000" end="00:43:23.100">They're quite gentle, really, but people<br />avoid them because they're a bit...</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.000" end="00:43:27.600">Different.</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.700" end="00:43:33.200">But why can't the others see them?</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.300" end="00:43:36.800">They can only be seen<br />by people who've seen death.</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.900" end="00:43:41.700">So you've known someone<br />who's died, then?</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.700" end="00:43:43.300">My mum.</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.900" end="00:43:48.800">She was quite an extraordinary witch,<br />but she did like to experiment...</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.000" end="00:43:52.300">...and one day,<br />one of her spells went badly wrong.</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.400" end="00:43:54.800">- I was 9.<br />- I'm sorry.</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.400" end="00:43:57.600">Yes, it was rather horrible.</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.800" end="00:44:03.100">I do feel very sad about it sometimes,<br />but I've got Dad.</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.300" end="00:44:08.000">We both believe you, by the way.</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.000" end="00:44:14.000">That He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back,<br />and you fought him...</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.200" end="00:44:17.300">...and the Ministry and the Prophet<br />are conspiring against you.</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.500" end="00:44:21.900">Thanks. It seems you're about<br />the only ones that do.</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.000" end="00:44:24.100">I don't think that's true.</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.700" end="00:44:28.900">But I suppose<br />that's how he wants you to feel.</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.000" end="00:44:30.800">What do you mean?</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.400" end="00:44:33.700">Well, if I were You-Know-Who...</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.800" end="00:44:37.300">...I'd want you to feel cut off<br />from everyone else...</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.500" end="00:44:40.200">...because if it's just you alone...</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.100" end="00:44:43.600">...you're not as much of a threat.</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.100" end="00:45:05.800">- Do you ever stop eating?<br />- What? I'm hungry.</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.200" end="00:45:10.300">Harry.</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.100" end="00:45:13.600">Can I join you?</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.200" end="00:45:18.300">Pardon me, professor,<br />but what exactly are you insinuating?</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.500" end="00:45:21.300">I am merely requesting<br />that when it comes to my students...</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.500" end="00:45:25.700">...you conform to the prescribed<br />disciplinary practices.</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.900" end="00:45:27.600">So silly of me, but it sounds...</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.700" end="00:45:31.900">...as if you're questioning my authority<br />in my own classroom...</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.000" end="00:45:33.400">...Minerva.</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.500" end="00:45:38.000">Not at all, Dolores,<br />merely your medieval methods.</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.300" end="00:45:40.700">I am sorry, dear.</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.900" end="00:45:44.200">But to question my practices<br />is to question the Ministry...</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.400" end="00:45:47.500">...and by extension,<br />the minister himself.</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.700" end="00:45:54.500">I am a tolerant woman...<br />...but the one thing<br />I will not stand for is disloyalty.</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.300" end="00:45:58.100">Disloyalty.</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.800" end="00:46:03.800">Things at Hogwarts<br />are far worse than I feared.</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.000" end="00:46:07.400">Cornelius will want<br />to take immediate action.</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.800" end="00:46:23.500">What's happened to Dumbledore?<br />Having already revolutionized...</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.600" end="00:46:26.900">...the teaching<br />of Defense Against the Dark Arts...</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.000" end="00:46:31.800">...Dolores Umbridge will,<br />as high inquisitor, have powers...</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.000" end="00:46:38.100">...to address the seriously falling<br />standards at Hogwarts School.</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.900" end="00:46:48.100">Just one question, dear.</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.200" end="00:46:52.400">You've been in this post<br />how long, exactly?</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.200" end="00:47:04.300">You applied first for the Defense Against<br />the Dark Arts post, is that correct?</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.500" end="00:47:06.500">Yes.</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.900" end="00:47:09.600">But you were unsuccessful?</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.800" end="00:47:13.200">Obviously.</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.500" end="00:47:49.000">Could you please predict something<br />for me?</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.700" end="00:47:52.000">I'm sorry?</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.100" end="00:47:59.300">Move those mouths.</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.500" end="00:48:08.600">One teensy little prophecy?</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.500" end="00:48:15.900">Pity.</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.500" end="00:48:21.200">No, wait. Wait, no.<br />I think I do see something.<br />Yes, I do. Something dark.</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.500" end="00:48:26.000">You are in grave danger.</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.500" end="00:48:29.200">Lovely.</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.400" end="00:48:41.600">Cho. What's going on?</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.800" end="00:48:44.100">It's Professor Trelawney.</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.900" end="00:49:17.400">Sixteen years I've lived<br />and taught here.</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.600" end="00:49:20.500">Hogwarts is my home.</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.400" end="00:49:24.300">You can't do this.</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.800" end="00:49:28.000">Actually, I can.</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.900" end="00:49:41.600">Something you'd like to say?<br />Oh, there are several things<br />I would like to say.</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.700" end="00:49:43.200">There...</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.200" end="00:50:01.800">Professor McGonagall, might I ask you<br />to escort Sybil back inside?</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.100" end="00:50:05.600">Sybil, dear. This way.</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.800" end="00:50:07.300">Thank you.</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.400" end="00:50:12.500">Dumbledore, may I remind you<br />that under the terms...</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.600" end="00:50:15.900">...of Educational Decree Number 23,<br />as enacted by the minister...</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.100" end="00:50:19.200">You have the right<br />to dismiss my teachers.</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.400" end="00:50:23.000">You do not, however, have the authority<br />to banish them from the grounds.</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.200" end="00:50:26.200">That power remains<br />with the headmaster.</p>

<p begin="00:51:27.900" end="00:51:30.600">- What are you doing here?<br />- Answering your letter.</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.800" end="00:51:33.700">You said you were worried<br />about Umbridge. What's she doing?</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.900" end="00:51:35.800">Training you to kill half-breeds?</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.000" end="00:51:38.900">- She's not letting us use magic at all.<br />- Well, I'm not surprised.</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.300" end="00:51:44.500">The latest intelligence is that Fudge<br />doesn't want you trained in combat.<br />Combat?</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.000" end="00:51:49.500">What does he think, we're forming<br />some sort of wizard army?<br />That's exactly what he thinks.</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.700" end="00:51:53.900">That Dumbledore is assembling<br />his own forces to take on the Ministry.</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.100" end="00:51:57.400">He's becoming more paranoid<br />by the minute.</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.800" end="00:52:01.300">The others wouldn't want me<br />telling you this, Harry...</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.800" end="00:52:04.700">...but things aren't going at all well<br />with the Order.</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.800" end="00:52:07.400">Fudge is blocking the truth<br />at every turn...</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.600" end="00:52:11.600">...and these disappearances<br />are just how it started before.</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.400" end="00:52:15.800">Voldemort is on the move.</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.200" end="00:52:18.000">Well, what can we do?</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.200" end="00:52:19.800">Someone's coming.</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.800" end="00:52:27.100">I'm sorry I can't be of more help.<br />But for now, at least,<br />it looks like you're on your own.</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.700" end="00:52:41.100">He really is out there, isn't he?</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.900" end="00:52:45.700">We've got to be able<br />to defend ourselves.</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.100" end="00:52:50.200">And if Umbridge refuses to teach us how,<br />we need someone who will.</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.900" end="00:53:09.000">Harry.</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.600" end="00:53:22.600">This is mad.<br />Who'd wanna be taught by me?<br />I'm a nutter, remember?</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.600" end="00:53:27.100">Look on the bright side:<br />You can't be any worse than old toad face.</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.300" end="00:53:30.800">- Thanks, Ron.<br />- I'm here for you, mate.</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.300" end="00:53:35.900">Who's supposed to be<br />meeting us, then?<br />Just a couple of people.</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.900" end="00:53:42.400">Lovely spot.</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.100" end="00:53:50.500">Thought it would be safer<br />off the beaten track.<br />Matey, come back here.</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.000" end="00:54:00.100">Hi.</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.500" end="00:54:03.400">So you all know why we're here.</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.600" end="00:54:05.300">We need a teacher.</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.500" end="00:54:08.700">A proper teacher.</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.000" end="00:54:12.200">One who's had experience<br />defending themselves against the Dark Arts.</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.300" end="00:54:14.100">- Why?<br />- Why?</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.300" end="00:54:16.300">Because You-Know-Who's back,<br />you tosspot.</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.500" end="00:54:20.400">- So he says.<br />- So Dumbledore says.<br />So Dumbledore says because he says.</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.600" end="00:54:23.000">The point is, where's the proof?</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.300" end="00:54:28.100">If Potter could tell us more<br />about how Diggory got killed...</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.500" end="00:54:34.200">I'm not gonna talk about Cedric, so if<br />that's why you're here, clear out now.</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.400" end="00:54:37.800">Come on, Hermione. They're here because<br />they think I'm some sort of freak.</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.000" end="00:54:41.000">Is it true you can produce<br />a Patronus Charm?</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.900" end="00:54:45.400">Yes.</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.900" end="00:54:48.300">I've seen it.</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.500" end="00:54:50.600">Blimey, Harry.<br />I didn't know you could do that.</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.300" end="00:54:55.400">And he killed a basilisk, with the sword<br />in Dumbledore's office.</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.600" end="00:54:56.900">It's true.</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.000" end="00:55:00.800">Third year, he fought off<br />about a hundred Dementors at once.</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.000" end="00:55:05.300">Last year, he really did fight off<br />You-Know-Who in the flesh.<br />Wait.</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.000" end="00:55:10.500">Look, it all sounds great<br />when you say it like that...</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.700" end="00:55:14.300">...but the truth is,<br />most of that was just luck.</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.500" end="00:55:18.300">I didn't know what I was doing<br />half the time. I nearly always had help.</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.400" end="00:55:21.900">- He's just being modest.<br />- No, Hermione, I'm not.</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.500" end="00:55:29.200">Facing this stuff in real life<br />is not like school.</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.200" end="00:55:35.300">In school, if you make a mistake,<br />you can just try again tomorrow.<br />But out there...</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.900" end="00:55:39.200">...when you're a second away<br />from being murdered...</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.400" end="00:55:43.100">...or watching a friend die<br />right before your eyes...</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.900" end="00:55:48.300">You don't know what that's like.</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.500" end="00:55:59.800">You're right, Harry, we don't.</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.100" end="00:56:02.300">That's why we need your help.</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.400" end="00:56:05.900">Because if we're going to have<br />any chance at beating...</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.500" end="00:56:09.000">...Voldemort...</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.100" end="00:56:13.800">He's really back.</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.200" end="00:56:37.800">Right. First we need to find<br />a place to practice...</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.000" end="00:56:41.700">...where Umbridge won't find out.<br />- The Shrieking Shack.<br />- It's too small.</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.900" end="00:56:44.900">- Forbidden Forest?<br />- Not bloody likely.</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.000" end="00:56:48.600">Harry, what happens<br />if Umbridge does find out?<br />Who cares?</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.100" end="00:56:53.900">I mean, it's sort of exciting, isn't it,<br />breaking the rules?</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.100" end="00:56:56.400">Who are you and what have<br />you done with Hermione?</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.100" end="00:57:02.200">Anyway, at least we know one<br />positive thing that came from today.<br />What's that?</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.000" end="00:57:07.100">Cho couldn't take her eyes off you,<br />could she?</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.400" end="00:57:12.400">Right. Over the next few days,<br />we should each come up...</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.600" end="00:57:15.400">...with a couple of possibilities<br />of places we can practice.</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.600" end="00:57:21.400">We've got to make sure, wherever it is,<br />there's no chance she can find us.<br />Will do, Harry.</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.200" end="00:57:34.300">All student organizations<br />are henceforth disbanded.</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.500" end="00:57:38.100">Any student in noncompliance<br />will be expelled.</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.300" end="00:57:40.900">Watch where you're going, Longbottom.</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.500" end="00:58:20.700">You've done it, Neville.<br />You found the Room of Requirement.</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.900" end="00:58:22.100">The what?</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.200" end="00:58:24.600">It's also known as<br />the Come and Go Room.</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.800" end="00:58:28.200">The Room of Requirement only appears<br />when a person has real need of it.</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.400" end="00:58:34.900">And it's always equipped<br />for the seeker's needs.<br />So say you really needed the toilet...</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.100" end="00:58:40.900">Charming, Ronald.<br />But, yes, that is the general idea.</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.100" end="00:58:46.000">It's brilliant. It's like Hogwarts<br />wants us to fight back.</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.000" end="00:58:58.500">Expelliarmus.</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.700" end="00:59:05.100">I'm hopeless.</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.200" end="00:59:09.700">You're just flourishing your wand too much.<br />Try it like this. Expelliarmus.</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.400" end="00:59:16.400">You will please copy<br />the approved text four times...</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.600" end="00:59:19.600">...to ensure maximum retention.</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.000" end="00:59:23.700">- There will be no need to talk.<br />- No need to think's more like it.</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.800" end="00:59:26.000">- Expelliarmus.<br />- Wands away.</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.800" end="00:59:41.900">Stunning is one of the most useful spells<br />in your arsenal.</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.000" end="00:59:48.000">It's a wizard's bread and butter, really.<br />So come on, then, Nigel.<br />Give it your best shot.</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.500" end="00:59:55.900">Stupefy!</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.800" end="01:00:05.300">Good. Not bad at all, Nigel. Well done.</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.600" end="01:00:13.000">Don't worry. I'll go easy on you.</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.100" end="01:00:15.100">Thanks, Ronald.</p>

<p begin="01:00:20.200" end="01:00:23.000">- You can do it.<br />- Come on, Ron.</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.600" end="01:00:25.700">- One Sickle.<br />- You're on.</p>

<p begin="01:00:39.700" end="01:00:41.600">- Thank you.<br />- Shut up.</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.000" end="01:00:46.600">I let her do that.<br />It's good manners, isn't it?</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.900" end="01:00:51.400">It was completely intentional.</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.000" end="01:01:20.000">Up you come.<br />Would you like a cup of tea?</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.300" end="01:01:26.200">Now, focus on a fixed point<br />and try again.</p>

<p begin="01:01:30.400" end="01:01:32.900">Very good. Keep your concentration.</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.000" end="01:01:36.500">Great.</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.800" end="01:01:39.400">A little higher.</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.900" end="01:01:50.700">I'm okay. I'm okay.</p>

<p begin="01:02:33.900" end="01:02:37.700">- Expelliarmus.<br />- Levicorpus. Got it.<br />Think of it this way.</p>

<p begin="01:04:42.900" end="01:04:45.500">- Have a great Christmas, Luna.<br />- We've been thinking.</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.700" end="01:04:48.100">We could always slip Umbridge<br />some Puking Pastilles.</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.300" end="01:04:50.900">Or Fever Fudge. They give you<br />massive, pus-filled boils...</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.100" end="01:04:53.900">Sounds great, guys.<br />Would you excuse me?</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.600" end="01:05:09.300">Are you all right? I heard Umbridge<br />gave you a rough time the other day.</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.500" end="01:05:11.900">Yeah. I'm okay.</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.600" end="01:05:15.400">Anyway, it's worth it.</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.700" end="01:05:23.900">It's just, learning all this...</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.500" end="01:05:27.900">...makes me wonder whether,<br />if he'd known it...</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.100" end="01:05:30.800">Cedric did know this stuff.</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.400" end="01:05:33.800">He was really good.</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.400" end="01:05:37.100">It's just, Voldemort was better.</p>

<p begin="01:06:36.300" end="01:06:40.400">I mean, she was sort of crying.<br />That bad at it, are you?</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.500" end="01:06:43.900">I'm sure Harry's kissing<br />was more than satisfactory.</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.100" end="01:06:48.300">Cho spends half her time<br />crying these days.</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.500" end="01:06:51.700">You'd think a bit of snogging<br />would cheer her up.</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.200" end="01:06:55.200">Don't you understand<br />how she must be feeling?</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.500" end="01:07:02.900">Well, obviously<br />she's feeling sad about Cedric...</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.100" end="01:07:06.200">...and confused about liking Harry<br />and guilty about kissing him...</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.300" end="01:07:09.600">...conflicted because Umbridge might<br />sack her mum from the Ministry...</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.700" end="01:07:14.400">...and frightened of failing her OWLs<br />because she's worrying about everything.</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.400" end="01:07:19.000">One person couldn't feel all that.<br />They'd explode.</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.200" end="01:07:23.000">Just because you've got<br />the emotional range of a teaspoon...</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.200" end="01:07:39.900">Harry.</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.700" end="01:07:51.700">Voldemort may be after something.</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.400" end="01:07:55.400">Something he didn't have last time.</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.200" end="01:07:57.600">Harry.</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.100" end="01:08:00.500">Harry.</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.500" end="01:08:34.900">In the dream,<br />were you standing next to the victim...</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.100" end="01:08:40.000">...or looking down at the scene?<br />Neither. It was like I...</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.600" end="01:08:45.200">Will you please just tell me<br />what's happening?<br />Everard, Arthur's on guard duty tonight.</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.300" end="01:08:47.700">Make sure he's found<br />by the right people.</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.900" end="01:08:49.500">- Sir.<br />- Phineas.</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.600" end="01:08:51.900">You must go to your portrait<br />at Grimmauld Place.</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.100" end="01:08:54.700">Tell them that Arthur Weasley<br />is gravely injured...</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.900" end="01:08:59.100">...and his children will be arriving there<br />soon by Portkey.</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.300" end="01:09:02.300">They've got him, Albus.<br />It was close, but they think he'll make it.</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.500" end="01:09:07.100">What's more,<br />the Dark Lord failed to acquire it.<br />Oh, thank goodness. Next we need to...</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.300" end="01:09:08.600">Look at me!</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.000" end="01:09:17.200">What's happening to me?</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.100" end="01:09:26.900">You wished to see me, headmaster?</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.100" end="01:09:32.000">Oh, Severus. I'm afraid we can't wait.<br />Not even till the morning.</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.400" end="01:09:35.300">Otherwise, we'll all be vulnerable.</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.100" end="01:09:44.200">It appears there's a connection...<br />...between the Dark Lord's mind<br />and your own.</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.400" end="01:09:48.500">Whether he is, as yet, aware of this<br />connection is, for the moment, unclear.</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.900" end="01:09:51.900">Pray he remains ignorant.</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.100" end="01:09:55.400">You mean, if he knows about it, then...</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.800" end="01:10:00.300">...he'll be able to read my mind?<br />- Read it, control it...</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.400" end="01:10:02.300">...unhinge it.</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.500" end="01:10:05.900">In the past, it was often<br />the Dark Lord's pleasure...</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.000" end="01:10:08.200">...to invade the minds of his victims...</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.400" end="01:10:12.100">...creating visions designed<br />to torture them into madness.</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.100" end="01:10:17.900">Only after extracting the last exquisite<br />ounce of agony...</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.100" end="01:10:22.500">...only when he had them literally<br />begging for death, would he finally...</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.500" end="01:10:23.900">...kill them.</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.700" end="01:10:27.200">Used properly,<br />the power of Occlumency...</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.300" end="01:10:30.800">...will help shield you<br />from access or influence.</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.000" end="01:10:35.800">In these lessons, I will attempt<br />to penetrate your mind.</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.400" end="01:10:39.400">You will attempt to resist.</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.700" end="01:10:41.300">Prepare yourself.</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.900" end="01:10:45.600">Legilimens.</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.300" end="01:10:56.900">Concentrate, Potter. Focus.</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.800" end="01:11:25.300">Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas.</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.600" end="01:11:28.300">Here we go.</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.400" end="01:11:30.600">Daddy's back.</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.800" end="01:11:37.400">Sit down, everybody, sit down.<br />That's it. Now, presents.</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.600" end="01:11:42.000">- And a nice big box for Ron.<br />- Big box for you. And...</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.800" end="01:11:49.400">Fred and George. Come on, open up.<br />- I want to see your faces.<br />- Yes.</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.600" end="01:11:52.000">- Try it on.<br />- Thanks, Mum. It's perfect.</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.200" end="01:11:56.500">- Just what he wanted, actually.<br />- Yeah. Right. Thanks, Mum.</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.600" end="01:12:01.700">Come on, then, everybody.<br />Let's clear this away.<br />Oh, Harry, Harry.</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.900" end="01:12:03.800">There you are.</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.800" end="01:12:07.100">- Happy Christmas.<br />- Thank you.</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.200" end="01:12:11.200">- Lovely to have you with us.<br />- Thank you.<br />Now, Daddy. Pass that to Daddy.</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.400" end="01:12:14.600">- Thank you.<br />- Has everybody got?<br />Fred? George?</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.800" end="01:12:17.300">- Hermione.<br />- A Christmas toast.</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.500" end="01:12:19.400">To Mr. Harry Potter...</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.400" end="01:12:23.200">...without whom I would not be here.</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.800" end="01:12:29.100">- Harry.<br />- Harry.</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.300" end="01:12:30.500">Harry.</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.500" end="01:12:34.100">That is delicious.<br />I shall be needing some more of that.</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.300" end="01:12:36.800">Daddy, don't forget last Christmas.</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.600" end="01:12:41.200">I can't understand<br />why you don't want to wear it, Ronald.</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.800" end="01:12:45.800">I look like a bloody idiot, that's why.<br />No more than usual, Ron.</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.900" end="01:12:47.700">I don't know why...</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.700" end="01:12:58.300">Nasty brat, standing there<br />as bold as brass.</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.500" end="01:13:03.200">Harry Potter,<br />the boy who stopped the Dark Lord.</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.400" end="01:13:06.400">Friend of Mudbloods<br />and blood-traitors alike.</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.800" end="01:13:09.400">- If my poor mistress only knew...<br />- Kreacher!</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.600" end="01:13:12.500">That's enough of your bile.<br />Away with you!</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.600" end="01:13:14.600">Of course, master.</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.700" end="01:13:19.400">Kreacher lives to serve<br />the noble house of Black.</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.800" end="01:13:23.700">Sorry about that.</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.200" end="01:13:27.900">He never was very pleasant,<br />even when I was a boy.</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.200" end="01:13:30.300">Not to me, anyway.</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.200" end="01:13:33.100">What, you grew up here?</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.300" end="01:13:35.500">This is my parents' house.</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.900" end="01:13:39.700">I offered it to Dumbledore<br />as headquarters for the Order.</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.800" end="01:13:44.100">About the only useful thing<br />I've been able to do.</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.500" end="01:13:47.900">This is the Black family tree.</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.800" end="01:13:50.900">My deranged cousin.</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.100" end="01:13:53.800">I hated the lot of them.</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.000" end="01:13:58.700">My parents with their pure-blood mania.</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.900" end="01:14:05.700">My mother did that after I ran away.</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.000" end="01:14:09.900">Charming woman.</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.200" end="01:14:12.800">I was 16.</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.600" end="01:14:15.200">Where did you go?</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.100" end="01:14:18.700">Round your dad's.</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.900" end="01:14:22.500">I was always welcome at the Potters'.</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.400" end="01:14:26.100">I see him so much in you, Harry.</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.700" end="01:14:28.900">You are so very much alike.</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.900" end="01:14:31.800">I'm not so sure.</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.900" end="01:14:34.700">Sirius, when I was...</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.200" end="01:14:41.700">When I saw Mr. Weasley attacked,<br />I wasn't just watching.</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.800" end="01:14:44.400">I was the snake.</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.200" end="01:14:48.100">And afterwards, in Dumbledore's office...</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.300" end="01:14:52.500">...there was a moment<br />when I wanted to...</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.700" end="01:15:00.500">This connection<br />between me and Voldemort.</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.200" end="01:15:05.100">What if the reason for it<br />is that I am becoming more like him?</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.100" end="01:15:11.000">I just feel so angry all the time.</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.200" end="01:15:15.800">And what if, after everything<br />that I've been through...</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.900" end="01:15:19.800">...something's gone wrong inside me?<br />What if I'm becoming bad?</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.100" end="01:15:25.400">I want you to listen to me<br />very carefully, Harry.</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.600" end="01:15:29.600">You're not a bad person.</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.400" end="01:15:34.800">You're a very good person<br />who bad things have happened to.</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.400" end="01:15:36.900">You understand?</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.600" end="01:15:43.600">Besides, the world isn't split<br />into good people and Death Eaters.</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.800" end="01:15:48.300">We've all got both light and dark<br />inside of us.</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.000" end="01:15:52.300">What matters<br />is the part we choose to act on.</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.200" end="01:15:56.500">That's who we really are.</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.300" end="01:16:02.000">Harry, time to go.</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.800" end="01:16:08.100">When all this is over,<br />we'll be a proper family.</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.200" end="01:16:09.800">You'll see.</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.000" end="01:16:12.300">Come on.</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.800" end="01:16:50.900">Really?</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.100" end="01:16:53.700">Harry. Harry.</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.900" end="01:16:55.800">Hagrid's back.</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.800" end="01:17:00.600">I'm sorry.</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.800" end="01:17:18.000">I will say this one last time.</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.300" end="01:17:23.900">I'm ordering you to tell me<br />where you've been.<br />I told you. I've been away for me health.</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.200" end="01:17:28.400">- Your health?<br />- Yeah. Bit of fresh air, you know.</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.500" end="01:17:33.400">Oh, yes. As gamekeeper,<br />fresh air must be difficult to come by.</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.400" end="01:17:37.900">If I were you,<br />I shouldn't get too used to being back.</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.100" end="01:17:41.300">In fact, I mightn't bother<br />unpacking at all.</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.300" end="01:18:03.400">This is top-secret, right?</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.300" end="01:18:08.300">Dumbledore sent me<br />to parley with the giants.<br />Giants?</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.600" end="01:18:10.600">You found them?</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.700" end="01:18:15.500">Well, they're not that hard to find, to<br />be perfectly honest. They're so big, see?</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.500" end="01:18:18.500">I tried to convince them<br />to join the cause.</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.700" end="01:18:21.400">But I wasn't the only one<br />that was trying to win them over.</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.100" end="01:18:24.000">- Death Eaters?<br />- Yes.</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.500" end="01:18:27.800">Trying to persuade them<br />to join You-Know-Who.</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.300" end="01:18:30.700">- Did they?<br />- I gave them Dumbledore's message.</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.900" end="01:18:35.000">Suppose some of them remember<br />he was friendly to them. I suppose.</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.600" end="01:18:40.600">And they did this to you?</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.600" end="01:18:42.300">Not exactly, no.</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.800" end="01:18:46.800">Oh, go on, you have it, then,<br />you dozy dog.</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.700" end="01:19:02.900">It's changing out there.</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.300" end="01:19:05.100">Just like last time.</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.300" end="01:19:08.600">There's a storm coming, Harry.</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.700" end="01:19:11.800">We'd all best be ready when she does.</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.800" end="01:19:51.800">We have confirmed<br />that 10 high-security prisoners...</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.000" end="01:19:54.800">in the early hours of yesterday evening<br />did escape.</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.000" end="01:19:58.700">And of course, the Muggle prime minister<br />has been alerted to the danger.</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.800" end="01:20:01.000">We strongly suspect...</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.800" end="01:20:03.800">...that the breakout was engineered...</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.900" end="01:20:08.100">...by a man with personal experience<br />in escaping from Azkaban...</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.300" end="01:20:12.500">...notorious mass murderer Sirius Black...</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.000" end="01:20:18.300">...cousin of escapee<br />Bellatrix Lestrange.</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.700" end="01:20:31.000">Dumbledore warned Fudge<br />this could happen.</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.100" end="01:20:35.600">He's gonna get us all killed<br />just because he can't face the truth.<br />Harry.</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.300" end="01:20:41.300">I wanted to apologize.</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.900" end="01:20:46.100">Now even me mum says the Prophet's<br />version of things don't add up.</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.200" end="01:20:52.100">So, what I'm really trying to say<br />is that I believe you.</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.100" end="01:21:00.700">Neville?</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.300" end="01:21:15.400">Fourteen years ago...</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.600" end="01:21:19.800">...a Death Eater<br />named Bellatrix Lestrange...</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.000" end="01:21:23.200">...used a<br />Cruciatus Curse on my parents.</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.800" end="01:21:27.700">She tortured them for information...</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.900" end="01:21:30.100">...but they never gave in.</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.800" end="01:21:34.200">I'm quite proud to be their son.</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.200" end="01:21:39.100">But I'm not sure<br />I'm ready for everyone to know just yet.</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.000" end="01:21:49.200">We're gonna make them proud, Neville.<br />That's a promise.</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.400" end="01:21:57.100">Make it a powerful memory,<br />the happiest you can remember.</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.300" end="01:22:00.700">Allow it to fill you up.<br />Keep trying, Seamus.</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.900" end="01:22:02.800">George, your turn now.</p>

<p begin="01:22:06.900" end="01:22:10.300">A full-bodied Patronus<br />is the most difficult to produce...</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.500" end="01:22:14.300">...but shield forms can also be equally<br />useful against a variety of opponents.</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.500" end="01:22:18.000">Wow, that was really good.<br />Fantastic, Ginny.</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.200" end="01:22:22.200">Just remember, your Patronus can only<br />protect you for as long as you stay focused.</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.400" end="01:22:24.700">So focus, Luna.</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.400" end="01:22:32.200">Think of the happiest thing you can.<br />Expecto Patronum.</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.400" end="01:22:35.200">- I'm trying.<br />- I know. It's good.</p>

<p begin="01:23:50.600" end="01:23:54.400">Been watching them for weeks.<br />And see, "Dumbledore's Army"...</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.600" end="01:23:59.100">...proof of what I've been telling you<br />right from the beginning, Cornelius.</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.700" end="01:24:03.500">All your fear-mongering<br />about You-Know-Who...<br />...never fooled us for a minute.</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.600" end="01:24:05.700">We saw your lies for what they were:</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.900" end="01:24:09.700">A smokescreen for your bid<br />to seize control of the Ministry.</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.900" end="01:24:13.600">Naturally.<br />No, professor.<br />He had nothing to do with it. It was me.</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.800" end="01:24:17.400">Most noble of you, Harry, to shield me,<br />but as has been pointed out...</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.600" end="01:24:22.400">...the parchment clearly says<br />"Dumbledore's Army," not "Potter's. "</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.600" end="01:24:25.200">I instructed Harry<br />to form this organization.</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.400" end="01:24:28.900">And I, and I alone,<br />am responsible for its activities.</p>

<p begin="01:24:41.400" end="01:24:46.500">...to await trial<br />for conspiracy and sedition.</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.700" end="01:24:49.700">I thought we might hit this little snag.</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.800" end="01:24:54.700">You seem to be laboring<br />under the delusion that I'm going to...</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.800" end="01:24:58.000">What was the phrase?<br />Come quietly.</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.200" end="01:25:00.300">Well, I can tell you this:</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.300" end="01:25:04.100">I have no intention of<br />going to Azkaban.<br />Enough of this.</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.600" end="01:25:05.800">Take him.</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.500" end="01:25:22.900">Well, you may not like him, minister...</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.100" end="01:25:25.200">...but you can't deny...</p>

<p begin="01:27:33.800" end="01:27:36.500">Even Dumbledore<br />didn't see this coming.</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.100" end="01:27:41.500">Harry, if it's anyone's fault, it's ours.<br />Yeah, we talked you into it.</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.700" end="01:27:43.600">Yeah, but I agreed.</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.200" end="01:27:48.300">I tried so hard to help,<br />and all it's done is make things worse.</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.400" end="01:27:53.000">Anyway, that doesn't matter anymore.</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.900" end="01:27:58.100">Because I don't want to play anymore.<br />All it does is make you care too much.</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.200" end="01:28:00.900">And the more you care,<br />the more you have to lose.</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.100" end="01:28:04.200">- So maybe it's just better to...<br />- To what?</p>

<p begin="01:28:34.100" end="01:28:36.800">I've never seen the centaurs so riled.</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.000" end="01:28:39.900">And they're dangerous<br />at the best of times.</p>

<p begin="01:28:43.000" end="01:28:47.000">...they'll have a full uprising<br />on their hands.<br />Hagrid, what's going on?</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.200" end="01:28:49.400">I'm sorry to be so mysterious, you three.</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.600" end="01:28:54.600">I wouldn't be bothering you at all with it,<br />but with Dumbledore gone...</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.200" end="01:28:58.400">...I'll likely be getting the sack<br />any day now.</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.500" end="01:29:02.300">And I just couldn't leave<br />without telling someone about him.</p>

<p begin="01:29:40.900" end="01:29:43.000">Well, half brother, really.</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.100" end="01:29:48.400">He's completely harmless, just like I said.<br />Little high-spirited, is all.</p>

<p begin="01:30:03.600" end="01:30:04.800">Grawp.</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.800" end="01:30:09.900">Put me down.</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.600" end="01:30:15.100">Now.</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.300" end="01:30:28.800">You all right?</p>

<p begin="01:30:39.100" end="01:30:41.800">You just stay away from her, all right?</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.400" end="01:31:14.200">He gets his own food and all.</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.400" end="01:31:18.500">It's company he'll be needing<br />when I'm gone.</p>

<p begin="01:31:54.100" end="01:31:57.200">Every memory he has access to<br />is a weapon he can use against you.</p>

<p begin="01:32:05.200" end="01:32:07.000">Lazy, arrogant.</p>

<p begin="02:06:20.500" end="02:06:24.000">But as it's the last night,<br />I really do need them back.</p>

<p begin="02:06:43.700" end="02:06:45.900">Anyway, my mum always said...</p>

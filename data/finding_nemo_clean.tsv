00:00:33,566	00:00:36,763	 Wow. Mmm.	0
00:00:36,803	00:00:39,897	 Wow. Mm-hmm.	0
00:00:39,939	00:00:42,066	 Wow. Yes, Marlin.	0
00:00:42,108	00:00:44,201	 No, I see it. It's beautiful.	0
00:00:44,244	00:00:46,769	 So, Coral, when you said you wanted an ocean view...	0
00:00:46,813	00:00:50,977	 you didnt think you'd get the whole ocean, did you?	0
00:00:51,017	00:00:55,818	 Oh, yeah. A fish can breathe out here.	0
00:00:55,855	00:00:57,789	 Did your man deliver, or did he deliver?	0
00:00:57,824	00:01:00,122	 My man delivered. And it wasn't so easy.	0
00:01:00,160	00:01:03,459	 Because a lot of other clownfish had their eyes on this place.	0
00:01:03,496	00:01:05,930	 You better believe they did... every single one of them.	0
00:01:05,965	00:01:07,990	 Mm-hmm. You did good.	0
00:01:08,034	00:01:10,662	 And the neighborhood is awesome.	0
00:01:20,680	00:01:22,341	 So, you do like it, dont you?	0
00:01:22,382	00:01:25,840	 No, no. I do, I do. I really do like it.	0
00:01:25,885	00:01:28,820	 But, Marlin, I know that the drop off is desirable...	0
00:01:28,855	00:01:31,119	 with the great schools and the amazing view...	0
00:01:31,157	00:01:32,926	 but do we really need so much space?	0
00:01:33,259	00:01:36,057	 Coral, honey, these are our kids we're talking about.	0
00:01:36,096	00:01:38,257	 They deserve the best. Look, look, look.	0
00:01:38,298	00:01:40,528	 They'll wake up, poke their little heads out...	1
00:01:40,567	00:01:41,434	 and they see a whale! Right by their bedroom window.	1
00:01:43,670	00:01:45,968	 Shh. You'll wake the kids.	1
00:01:46,005	00:01:47,802	 Oh, right, right.	1
00:01:51,544	00:01:56,311	 Aw, look. They're dreaming.	1
00:01:56,349	00:01:58,510	 We still have to name them.	1
00:01:58,551	00:02:00,314	 You want to name all of them right now?	1
00:02:00,353	00:02:03,618	 All right, we'll name this half Marlin Junior...	1
00:02:03,656	00:02:05,783	 and this half Coral Junior.	1
00:02:05,825	00:02:08,385	 OK, we're done. I like Nemo.	1
00:02:08,428	00:02:11,192	 Nemo. We'll name one Nemo...	1
00:02:11,231	00:02:13,791	 but I'd like most of them to be Marlin Junior.	1
00:02:13,833	00:02:15,198	 Just think, in a couple of days...	1
00:02:15,235	00:02:18,727	 we're going to be parents. Yeah.	1
00:02:18,771	00:02:20,398	 What if they dont like me?	1
00:02:20,440	00:02:21,964	 Marlin. No, really.	1
00:02:22,008	00:02:26,968	 There's over 400 eggs. Odds are, one will like you.	1
00:02:30,150	00:02:31,310	 What?	1
00:02:31,351	00:02:34,980	 You remember how we met? I try not to.	1
00:02:35,021	00:02:36,488	" Well, I remember. ""Excuse me, miss..."	1
00:02:36,523	00:02:38,991	" ""can you check and see if I have a hook in my lip?"""	1
00:02:39,025	00:02:41,391	 You got a little closer because it was wiggling.	1
00:02:41,427	00:02:44,555	 Get away, get away! Here he is. Cutie's here.	1
00:02:46,432	00:02:48,525	 Where did everybody go?	1
00:02:55,308	00:02:57,401	 Coral, get inside the house.	1
00:02:58,945	00:03:01,345	 No, Coral, dont. They'll be fine.	1
00:03:01,381	00:03:03,975	 Just get inside... You, right now.	1
00:03:06,753	00:03:08,618	 No! Ow!	1
00:03:08,655	00:03:10,555	 Oh!	1
00:03:10,590	00:03:12,251	 Ooh! Ooh!	1
00:03:27,140	00:03:28,402	 Coral!	2
00:03:33,913	00:03:35,881	 Coral?	2
00:04:12,552	00:04:13,746	 Oh!	2
00:04:17,724	00:04:19,692	 Ohh.	2
00:04:21,728	00:04:23,559	 There, there, there.	2
00:04:23,596	00:04:26,087	 It's OK. Daddy's here.	2
00:04:27,333	00:04:28,994	 Daddy's got you.	2
00:04:31,838	00:04:36,366	 I promise, I will never let anything happen to you...	2
00:04:36,409	00:04:38,172	 Nemo.	2
00:05:14,647	00:05:17,083	 First day of school!	3
00:05:17,083	00:05:19,881	 Wake up, wake up! First day of school.	3
00:05:19,919	00:05:22,410	 I dont want to go to school... five more minutes.	3
00:05:22,455	00:05:23,717	 Not you, Dad, me.	3
00:05:23,756	00:05:25,155	 OK. Huh? Get up, get up.	3
00:05:25,191	00:05:27,887	 It's time for school, time for school.	3
00:05:27,927	00:05:29,485	 All right, I'm up.	3
00:05:29,529	00:05:31,190	 Whoa!	3
00:05:31,230	00:05:32,959	 Nemo! First day of school!	3
00:05:32,999	00:05:35,160	 Nemo, dont move. Unh! Unh!	3
00:05:35,201	00:05:36,600	 You'll never get out of there yourself.	3
00:05:36,636	00:05:38,797	 I'll do it. Unh!	3
00:05:38,838	00:05:40,806	 You feel a break? No.	3
00:05:40,840	00:05:42,569	 Sometimes you cant tell 'cause fluid rushes to the area.	3
00:05:42,608	00:05:44,803	 Are you woozy? No.	3
00:05:44,844	00:05:47,108	 How many stripes do I have? I'm fine.	3
00:05:47,146	00:05:48,943	 Answer the stripe question. Three.	3
00:05:48,981	00:05:50,448	 No! See? Something's wrong with you.	3
00:05:50,483	00:05:53,281	 I have one, two, three... That's all I have?	3
00:05:53,319	00:05:56,220	 You're OK. How's the lucky fin?	3
00:05:56,255	00:05:59,053	 Lucky. Let's see.	3
00:06:00,526	00:06:02,016	 Are you sure you want to go to school this year?	3
00:06:02,061	00:06:04,962	 There's no problem if you dont. You can wait 5 or 6 years.	3
00:06:04,997	00:06:06,862	 Come on, Dad, it's time for school.	3
00:06:06,899	00:06:09,561	 Forgot to brush. Ohh.	3
00:06:09,602	00:06:11,593	 Do you want this anemone to sting you?	3
00:06:11,637	00:06:14,037	 Yes. Brush.	3
00:06:14,073	00:06:15,734	 OK, I'm done. You missed a spot.	3
00:06:15,775	00:06:16,075	 Where? There.	3
00:06:17,777	00:06:20,746	 Ha ha! Right there. And here and here.	3
00:06:29,522	00:06:29,722	 All right, we're excited.	3
00:06:30,923	00:06:32,686	 The first day of school. Here we go.	3
00:06:32,725	00:06:34,693	 We're ready to learn to get some knowledge.	4
00:06:34,727	00:06:37,127	 What's the one thing we have to remember about the ocean?	4
00:06:37,163	00:06:39,597	 It's not safe. That's my boy.	4
00:06:39,632	00:06:41,896	 First, we check to see that the coast is clear.	4
00:06:41,934	00:06:44,334	 We go out... and back in.	4
00:06:44,370	00:06:46,668	 And then we go out... and back in.	4
00:06:46,706	00:06:49,732	 And then one more time... out and back in.	4
00:06:49,776	00:06:51,607	 And sometimes, if you want to do it four times...	4
00:06:51,644	00:06:54,010	 Dad... All right, come on, boy.	4
00:06:56,716	00:06:59,810	 Maybe while I'm at school, I'll see a shark.	4
00:06:59,852	00:07:02,514	 I highly doubt that. Have you ever met a shark?	4
00:07:02,555	00:07:04,216	 No, and I dont plan to.	4
00:07:04,257	00:07:07,454	 How old are sea turtles? I dont know.	4
00:07:07,493	00:07:09,188	 Sandy Plankton from next door...	4
00:07:09,228	00:07:12,131	 he says that sea turtles live to be about 100 years old.	4
00:07:14,600	00:07:16,864	 If I ever meet a sea turtle, I'll ask him.	4
00:07:16,903	00:07:18,837	 After I'm done talking to the shark, OK?	4
00:07:18,871	00:07:20,440	 Whoa! Hold on. Wait to cross.	4
00:07:22,508	00:07:24,703	 Hold my fin.	4
00:07:24,744	00:07:26,075	 Dad, you're not going to freak out...	4
00:07:26,112	00:07:28,103	 like you did at the petting zoo, are you?	4
00:07:28,147	00:07:30,911	 That snail was about to charge.	4
00:07:30,950	00:07:33,384	 Hmm. I wonder where we're supposed to go.	4
00:07:33,419	00:07:34,909	 Bye, Mom!	4
00:07:34,954	00:07:37,047	 I'll pick you up after school.	4
00:07:37,089	00:07:38,784	 Ha ha!	4
00:07:38,825	00:07:41,885	 Come on, you guys, stop it! Give it back!	4
00:07:41,928	00:07:44,920	 Come on, we'll try over there.	4
00:07:46,265	00:07:48,324	 Excuse me, is this where we meet his teacher?	4
00:07:48,367	00:07:50,892	 Well, look who's out of the anemone.	4
00:07:50,937	00:07:51,637	 Yes. Shocking, I know.	4
00:07:52,171	00:07:53,934	 Marty, right? Marlin.	4
00:07:53,973	00:07:55,133	 Bob. Ted.	4
00:07:55,174	00:07:57,165	 Bill. Hey, you're a clownfish.	4
00:07:57,210	00:07:59,770	 You're funny, right? Tell us a joke.	4
00:07:59,812	00:08:01,109	 Yeah. Yeah.	4
00:08:01,147	00:08:04,048	 Well, actually, that's a common misconception.	4
00:08:04,083	00:08:06,608	 Clownfish are no funnier than any other fish.	4
00:08:06,652	00:08:08,643	 Come on, clownie. Do something funny.	4
00:08:08,688	00:08:11,156	 All right, I know one joke.	4
00:08:11,190	00:08:15,251	 There's a mollusk, see? And he walks up to a sea...	5
00:08:15,294	00:08:17,353	 He doesnt walk up, he swims up.	5
00:08:17,396	00:08:19,261	 Actually, the mollusk isn't moving.	5
00:08:19,298	00:08:22,859	 He's in one place, and then the sea cucumber...	5
00:08:22,902	00:08:24,369	 Well, they... I'm mixed up.	5
00:08:24,403	00:08:27,133	 There was a mollusk and a sea cucumber.	5
00:08:27,173	00:08:28,174	 None of them were walking, so forget that l...	5
00:08:28,774	00:08:32,005	 Sheldon! Get out of Mr. Johannsen's yard now!	5
00:08:32,044	00:08:34,410	 Whoa! All right, you kids!	5
00:08:34,447	00:08:37,507	 Ooh, where'd you go?	5
00:08:37,550	00:08:39,711	 Dad, can I go play, too? Can I?	5
00:08:39,752	00:08:42,744	 I would feel better if you'd play on the sponge beds.	5
00:08:47,326	00:08:49,294	 That's where I would play.	5
00:08:50,930	00:08:53,364	 What's wrong with his fin? He looks funny.	5
00:08:53,399	00:08:55,765	 Ow! Hey, what'd I do?	5
00:08:55,801	00:08:57,769	 Be nice. It's his first time at school.	5
00:08:57,803	00:09:00,499	 He was born with it. We call it his lucky fin.	5
00:09:00,606	00:09:02,801	 Dad... See this tentacle?	5
00:09:02,842	00:09:04,969	 It's actually shorter than all my other tentacles...	5
00:09:05,011	00:09:07,138	 but you cant really tell.	5
00:09:07,179	00:09:09,613	 Especially when I twirl them like this.	5
00:09:09,649	00:09:11,708	 I'm H-2-O intolerant.	5
00:09:11,751	00:09:13,719	 Ah-choo! I'm obnoxious.	5
00:09:13,753	00:09:15,311	 Oh	5
00:09:15,354	00:09:18,187	 Let's name the zones, the zones, the zones	5
00:09:18,224	00:09:21,387	 Let's name the zones of the open sea	5
00:09:21,427	00:09:22,621	 Mr. Ray!	5
00:09:22,662	00:09:25,563	 Come on, Nemo. You better stay with me.	5
00:09:25,598	00:09:27,463	 Mesopelagic, bathyal, abyssalpelagic	5
00:09:27,500	00:09:30,936	 All the rest are too deep for you and me to see	5
00:09:30,970	00:09:34,303	 Huh. I wonder where my class has gone?	5
00:09:34,340	00:09:36,069	 We're under here!	5
00:09:36,108	00:09:37,973	 Oh, there you are.	5
00:09:38,010	00:09:39,568	 Climb aboard, explorers.	5
00:09:39,612	00:09:40,909	 Oh, knowledge exploring	5
00:09:40,947	00:09:42,437	 Is, oh, so lyrical	5
00:09:42,481	00:09:44,915	 When you think thoughts that are empirical	5
00:09:44,951	00:09:46,111	 Dad, you can go now.	5
00:09:46,152	00:09:49,246	 Hello. Who is this? I'm Nemo.	5
00:09:49,288	00:09:52,951	 Nemo, all new explorers must answer a science question.	6
00:09:52,992	00:09:55,790	 OK. You live in what kind of home?	6
00:09:55,828	00:09:57,523	 An anemon-none.	6
00:09:57,563	00:09:59,554	 A nemenem-menome.	6
00:09:59,599	00:10:02,625	 OK, dont hurt yourself. Welcome aboard, explorers.	6
00:10:02,668	00:10:04,602	 Just so you know, he's got a little fin.	6
00:10:04,637	00:10:06,298	 I find if he's having trouble swimming...	6
00:10:06,339	00:10:08,307	 I let him take a break, 10, 15 minutes.	6
00:10:08,341	00:10:10,775	 Dad, it's time for you to go now.	6
00:10:10,810	00:10:12,869	 Don't worry. We're gonna stay together as a group.	6
00:10:12,912	00:10:15,312	 OK, class, optical orbits up front.	6
00:10:15,348	00:10:18,340	 And remember, we keep our supraesophogeal ganglion...	6
00:10:18,384	00:10:20,818	 to ourselves. That means you, Jimmy.	6
00:10:20,853	00:10:20,953	 Aw, man!	6
00:10:22,855	00:10:24,880	 Bye, Nemo!	6
00:10:24,924	00:10:26,323	 Bye, Dad!	6
00:10:26,359	00:10:28,020	 Bye, son!	6
00:10:30,229	00:10:32,026	 Be safe.	6
00:10:32,064	00:10:34,624	 You're doing pretty well for a first-timer.	6
00:10:34,667	00:10:36,999	 You cant hold on to them forever, can you?	6
00:10:37,036	00:10:39,266	 I had a tough time with my oldest out at the drop off.	6
00:10:39,305	00:10:41,569	 They got to grow up... The drop off?	6
00:10:41,607	00:10:44,474	 They're going to the drop off? What are you, insane?	6
00:10:44,510	00:10:47,809	 Why dont we fry them up now and serve them with chips?	6
00:10:47,847	00:10:49,109	 Hey, Marty, calm down.	6
00:10:49,148	00:10:51,412	 Don't tell me to be calm, pony boy.	6
00:10:51,450	00:10:53,748	 Pony boy?	6
00:10:53,786	00:10:56,653	 For a clownfish, he really isn't that funny.	6
00:10:56,689	00:10:58,088	 Pity.	6
00:10:58,157	00:10:59,988	 Oh	6
00:11:00,026	00:11:02,586	 Let's name the species, the species, the species	6
00:11:02,628	00:11:03,925	 Let's name the species that live in the sea	6
00:11:03,963	00:11:05,123	 Whoa.	6
00:11:05,164	00:11:06,961	 There's	6

00:11:15,241	00:11:16,572	 Come on, sing with me.	6
00:11:16,609	00:11:18,941	 Oh	6
00:11:23,816	00:11:25,681	 Just the girls this time.	6
00:11:25,718	00:11:27,686	 Oh, seaweed is cool	7
00:11:27,720	00:11:28,982	 Seaweed is fun	7
00:11:29,021	00:11:30,488	 It makes its food	7
00:11:33,793	00:11:35,818	 OK, the drop off.	7
00:11:35,861	00:11:38,125	 All right, kids, feel free to explore...	7
00:11:38,164	00:11:39,324	 but stay close.	7
00:11:39,365	00:11:41,560	 Stromalitic cyanobacteria! Gather.	7
00:11:42,902	00:11:45,632	 An entire ecosystem contained in one infinitesimal speck.	7
00:11:45,671	00:11:47,332	 There are as many protein pairs contained in this...	7
00:11:47,373	00:11:49,807	 Come on, let's go.	7
00:11:49,842	00:11:51,207	 Come on, sing with me!	7

00:11:56,615	00:11:59,675	 Hey, guys, wait up!	7
00:11:59,719	00:12:01,983	 Whoa.	7
00:12:04,623	00:12:06,716	 Cool.	7
00:12:08,394	00:12:10,021	 Saved your life!	7
00:12:10,062	00:12:12,394	 Aw, you guys made me ink.	7
00:12:13,833	00:12:15,266	 What's that?	7
00:12:16,702	00:12:19,728	 I know what that is. Sandy Plankton saw one.	7
00:12:19,772	00:12:22,866	 He said it was called a butt.	7
00:12:22,908	00:12:24,341	 Whoa. Wow.	7
00:12:24,376	00:12:26,674	 That's a pretty big butt.	7
00:12:28,147	00:12:31,344	 Oh, look at me. I'm going to touch the butt.	7
00:12:31,383	00:12:33,851	 Ah-choo! Whoa! Ha ha ha!	7
00:12:33,886	00:12:36,684	 Oh, yeah? Let's see you get closer.	7
00:12:36,722	00:12:38,349	 OK.	7
00:12:38,390	00:12:40,881	 Beat that.	7
00:12:40,926	00:12:43,451	 Come on, Nemo. How far can you go?	7
00:12:43,496	00:12:45,964	 My dad says it's not safe.	7
00:12:45,998	00:12:48,933	 Nemo! No! Dad?	7
00:12:48,968	00:12:50,401	 You were about to swim into open water.	7
00:12:50,436	00:12:51,664	 No, I wasn't...	7
00:12:51,704	00:12:53,535	 Good thing I was here. If I hadn't shown up...	7
00:12:53,572	00:12:55,836	 He wasn't going to go. He was too afraid.	7
00:12:55,875	00:12:57,172	 No, I wasn't.	7
00:12:57,209	00:12:58,642	 This does not concern you, kids...	7
00:12:58,677	00:13:01,043	 and you're lucky I dont tell your parents.	7
00:13:01,080	00:13:02,377	 You know you cant swim well.	7
00:13:02,414	00:13:04,348	 I can swim fine, Dad, OK?	7
00:13:04,383	00:13:07,284	 No, it's not OK. You shouldnt be near here.	8
00:13:07,319	00:13:09,719	 OK, I was right. You'll start school in a year or two.	8
00:13:09,755	00:13:12,485	 No, Dad! Just because you're scared of the ocean...	8
00:13:12,525	00:13:12,992	 Clearly, you're not ready...	8
00:13:13,726	00:13:14,886	 and you're not coming back until you are.	8
00:13:14,927	00:13:16,189	 You think you can do these things...	8
00:13:16,228	00:13:18,128	 but you just cant, Nemo!	8
00:13:19,465	00:13:21,057	 I hate you.	8
00:13:22,268	00:13:24,896	 There's	8
00:13:24,937	00:13:26,768	 Nothing to see. Gather. Over there.	8
00:13:26,806	00:13:28,068	 Excuse me. Is there anything I can do?	8
00:13:28,107	00:13:30,166	 I am a scientist, sir. Is there any problem?	8
00:13:30,209	00:13:32,302	 I'm sorry. I didnt mean to interrupt things.	8
00:13:32,344	00:13:35,177	 He isn't a good swimmer, and it's a little too soon...	8
00:13:35,214	00:13:36,943	 for him to be out here unsupervised.	8
00:13:36,982	00:13:38,745	 I can assure you, he's quite safe with me.	8
00:13:38,784	00:13:41,753	 I'm sure he is, but you have a large class...	8
00:13:41,787	00:13:44,620	 and he can get lost from sight if you're not looking.	8
00:13:44,657	00:13:44,857	 I'm not saying you're not looking.	8
00:13:45,891	00:13:48,826	 Oh, my gosh! Nemo's swimming out to sea!	8
00:13:50,629	00:13:51,891	 Nemo!	8
00:13:53,299	00:13:54,994	 What do you think you're doing?	8
00:13:55,034	00:13:57,832	 You'll get stuck out there...	8
00:13:57,870	00:14:01,362	 and I'll have to get you before another fish does.	8
00:14:01,473	00:14:03,304	 Get back here!	8
00:14:03,342	00:14:06,334	 I said get back here now!	8
00:14:06,378	00:14:11,213	 Stop! You take one more move, mister...	8
00:14:11,250	00:14:13,115	 Don't you dare!	8
00:14:13,152	00:14:15,211	 If you put one fin on that boat...	8
00:14:15,254	00:14:16,744	 Are you listening to me?	8
00:14:16,789	00:14:20,418	 Don't touch the bo... Nemo!	8
00:14:20,459	00:14:22,086	 He touched the butt.	8
00:14:22,127	00:14:24,857	 You paddle your little tail right back here, Nemo.	8
00:14:24,897	00:14:26,057	 That's right.	8
00:14:26,098	00:14:27,793	 You are in big trouble, young man.	8
00:14:27,833	00:14:29,630	 Do you hear me? Big...	8
00:14:31,437	00:14:33,405	 Big... Aah!	8
00:14:34,773	00:14:36,604	 Aah!	8
00:14:36,642	00:14:38,701	 Daddy! Help me!	8
00:14:38,744	00:14:41,713	 I'm coming, Nemo!	8
00:14:43,015	00:14:44,949	 Aah! Get under me, kids!	9
00:14:44,984	00:14:46,383	 Aah! Oh! No!	9
00:14:46,418	00:14:48,113	 Dad!	9
00:14:48,153	00:14:50,553	 Daddy!	9
00:14:53,792	00:14:56,659	 Oh! Nemo!	9
00:14:59,098	00:15:01,089	 Unh. Nemo!	9
00:15:01,133	00:15:04,762	 Nemo, no! Nemo!	9
00:15:04,803	00:15:07,772	 Nemo! Nemo! No!	9
00:15:09,675	00:15:12,166	 No!	9
00:15:12,211	00:15:15,112	 Aah!	9
00:15:16,448	00:15:19,474	 Uhh.	9
00:15:21,120	00:15:22,610	 Nemo! Nemo!	9
00:15:32,865	00:15:34,127	 Whoa! Hold on.	9
00:15:46,912	00:15:48,140	 Oh, no.	9
00:15:48,180	00:15:50,774	 No. No, it's gone. It's gone.	9
00:15:50,816	00:15:52,113	 No, no, it cant be gone.	9
00:15:52,151	00:15:54,483	 No, no! Nemo!	9
00:15:54,520	00:15:56,121	 Nemo! Nemo!	9
00:15:57,756	00:15:59,986	 No!	9
00:16:00,092	00:16:02,686	 Nemo! Nemo!	9
00:16:02,728	00:16:05,526	 No! No, please, no!	9
00:16:08,334	00:16:09,528	 No, no!	9
00:16:11,470	00:16:13,461	 Has anybody seen a boat?	9
00:16:13,505	00:16:15,336	 Please! A white boat!	9
00:16:15,374	00:16:17,035	 They took my son!	9
00:16:17,076	00:16:19,578	 My son! Help me, please.	9
00:16:19,578	00:16:21,478	 Look out! What?	10
00:16:21,513	00:16:23,913	 Ooh. Ohh.	10
00:16:23,949	00:16:27,544	 Ohh. Oh, oh. Sorry. I didnt see you.	10
00:16:27,586	00:16:30,885	 Sir? Are you OK? He's gone, he's gone.	10
00:16:30,923	00:16:32,356	 There, there. It's all right.	10
00:16:32,391	00:16:33,653	 He's gone. It'll be OK.	10
00:16:33,692	00:16:37,253	 No, no. They took him away. I have to find the boat.	10
00:16:37,296	00:16:39,355	 A boat? Hey, I've seen a boat.	10
00:16:39,398	00:16:41,696	 You have? It passed by not too long ago.	10
00:16:41,734	00:16:44,100	 A white one? Hi. I'm Dory.	10
00:16:44,136	00:16:45,330	 Where? Which way?	10
00:16:45,371	00:16:47,532	 Oh, oh, oh. It went this way.	10
00:16:47,573	00:16:48,972	 It went this way. Follow me.	10
00:16:49,008	00:16:52,375	 Thank you. Thank you, thank you so much.	10
00:16:52,411	00:16:53,537	 No problem.	10
00:17:18,537	00:17:20,129	 Hey...	10
00:17:20,172	00:17:21,571	 Wait!	10
00:17:27,679	00:17:29,772	 Will you quit it? What?	10
00:17:29,815	00:17:32,579	 I'm trying to swim here. Ocean isn't big enough for you?	10
00:17:32,618	00:17:32,951	 You got a problem, buddy? Huh? Huh?	10
00:17:34,853	00:17:37,549	 Do you? Do you? You want a piece of me?	10
00:17:37,589	00:17:39,454	 Ooh, I'm scared now. What?	10
00:17:39,491	00:17:42,085	 Wait a minute. Stop following me, OK?	10
00:17:42,127	00:17:45,255	 What? You're showing me where the boat went.	10
00:17:45,297	00:17:46,899	 A boat? Hey, I've seen a boat.	10
00:17:47,132	00:17:50,329	 It passed by not too long ago. It went this way.	10
00:17:50,369	00:17:51,768	 It went this way. Follow me.	10
00:17:51,804	00:17:53,931	 Wait a minute. What is going on?	10
00:17:53,972	00:17:56,270	 You already told me which way the boat was going.	10
00:17:56,308	00:17:59,505	 I did? Oh, no.	10
00:17:59,545	00:18:01,843	 If this is some kind of practical joke, it's not funny.	11
00:18:01,880	00:18:04,178	 And I know funny. I'm a clownfish.	11
00:18:04,216	00:18:07,617	 No, it's not. I know it's not. I'm so sorry.	11
00:18:07,653	00:18:10,622	 See, I suffer from short-term memory loss.	11
00:18:10,656	00:18:14,490	 Short-term memory loss. I dont believe this.	11
00:18:14,526	00:18:16,391	 No, it's true. I forget things almost instantly.	11
00:18:16,428	00:18:20,387	 It runs in my family. At least, I think it does.	11
00:18:20,432	00:18:24,459	 Um, hmm. Where are they?	11
00:18:29,208	00:18:30,642	 Can I help you?	11
00:18:30,642	00:18:33,304	 Something's wrong with you... really.	11
00:18:33,345	00:18:35,210	 You're wasting my time.	11
00:18:35,247	00:18:37,306	 I have to find my son.	11
00:18:40,586	00:18:42,110	 Hello.	11
00:18:42,154	00:18:44,145	 Ohh. Well, hi!	11
00:18:44,189	00:18:47,215	 Name's Bruce.	11
00:18:47,259	00:18:49,022	 It's all right. I understand.	11
00:18:49,061	00:18:52,792	 Why trust a shark, right?	11
00:18:59,872	00:19:02,966	 So, what's a couple of bites like you...	11
00:19:03,008	00:19:04,669	 doing out so late, eh?	11
00:19:04,710	00:19:06,735	 We're not doing anything. We're not even out.	11
00:19:06,778	00:19:09,008	 Great! Then how'd you morsels...	11
00:19:09,047	00:19:12,312	 like to come to a little get-together I'm having?	11
00:19:12,351	00:19:13,545	 You mean, like a party?	11
00:19:13,585	00:19:17,646	 Yeah, right. A party. What do you say?	11
00:19:17,689	00:19:19,850	 I love parties. That sounds like fun.	11
00:19:19,892	00:19:22,292	 Parties are fun, and it's tempting, but...	11
00:19:22,327	00:19:26,229	 Oh, come on, I insist.	11
00:19:26,265	00:19:29,462	 OK. That's all that matters.	11
00:19:32,104	00:19:34,265	 Hey, look, balloons. It is a party.	11
00:19:34,306	00:19:36,638	 Ha ha ha ha! Mind your distance, though.	12
00:19:36,675	00:19:39,337	 Those balloons can be a bit dodgy.	12
00:19:39,378	00:19:41,676	 You wouldnt want one of them to pop.	12
00:19:50,722	00:19:52,155	 Oh.	12
00:19:53,425	00:19:54,619	 Ohh.	12
00:19:55,627	00:19:58,255	 Anchor! Chum!	12
00:19:58,297	00:20:01,095	 There you are, Bruce. Finally.	12
00:20:01,133	00:20:03,795	 We got company. It's about time, mate.	12
00:20:03,835	00:20:04,703	 We've already gone through the snacks...	12
00:20:05,337	00:20:06,895	 and I'm still starving.	12
00:20:06,939	00:20:09,134	 We almost had a feeding frenzy.	12
00:20:09,174	00:20:10,903	 Come on, let's get this over with.	12
00:20:12,144	00:20:13,736	 Right, then.	12
00:20:13,779	00:20:16,077	 The meeting has officially come to order.	12
00:20:16,114	00:20:17,604	 Let us all say the pledge.	12
00:20:17,649	00:20:22,143	 I am a nice shark, not a mindless eating machine.	12
00:20:22,187	00:20:24,815	 If I am to change this image...	12
00:20:24,856	00:20:27,290	 I must first change myself.	12
00:20:27,326	00:20:30,056	 Fish are friends, not food.	12
00:20:30,095	00:20:31,426	 Except stinkin' dolphins.	12
00:20:31,463	00:20:34,489	 Dolphins. Yeah. They think they're so cute.	12
00:20:34,533	00:20:36,262	" ""Look at me. I'm a flippin' little dolphin."	12
00:20:36,301	00:20:37,962	" ""Let me flip for you. Ain't I something?"""	12
00:20:38,003	00:20:40,597	 Right, then. Today's meeting is Step 5...	12
00:20:40,639	00:20:42,300	 Bring a Fish Friend.	12
00:20:42,341	00:20:43,831	 Do you all have your friends?	12
00:20:43,875	00:20:45,035	 Got mine.	12
00:20:46,945	00:20:49,038	 Hey, there. How about you, Chum?	12
00:20:49,081	00:20:53,609	 Oh, I... seem to have misplaced my friend.	12
00:20:55,220	00:20:56,585	 That's all right, Chum.	12
00:20:56,622	00:20:58,146	 I had a feeling this would be a difficult step.	12
00:20:58,190	00:20:59,714	 You can help yourself to one of my friends.	12
00:20:59,758	00:21:03,216	 Thanks, mate. A little chum for Chum, eh?	12
00:21:03,262	00:21:04,923	 I'll start the testimonies.	12
00:21:04,963	00:21:07,193	 Hello. My name is Bruce.	12
00:21:07,232	00:21:08,494	 Hello, Bruce.	12
00:21:08,533	00:21:10,694	 It has been three weeks since my last fish.	12
00:21:10,736	00:21:14,172	 On my honor, or may I be chopped up and made into soup.	12
00:21:14,206	00:21:16,970	 You're an inspiration! Amen.	13
00:21:18,210	00:21:19,643	 Right, then. Who's next?	13
00:21:19,678	00:21:20,975	 Pick me, pick me.	13
00:21:21,013	00:21:22,878	 Yes. The little Sheila down the front.	13
00:21:22,914	00:21:24,973	 Whoo! Come on up here.	13
00:21:25,951	00:21:27,816	 Hi. I'm Dory.	13
00:21:27,853	00:21:30,253	 Hello, Dory. And, uh, well...	13
00:21:30,289	00:21:33,452	 I dont think I've ever eaten a fish.	13
00:21:33,492	00:21:37,053	 That's incredible. Good on you, mate.	13
00:21:37,095	00:21:39,120	 I'm glad I got that off my chest.	13
00:21:39,164	00:21:40,495	 All right, anyone else?	13
00:21:40,532	00:21:43,126	 How about you, mate? What's your problem?	13
00:21:43,168	00:21:45,398	 Me? I dont have a problem.	13
00:21:45,437	00:21:46,802	 Oh, OK.	13
00:21:46,838	00:21:48,430	 Denial. Aah!	13
00:21:48,473	00:21:50,304	 Just start with your name.	13
00:21:50,342	00:21:53,038	 OK. Uh, hello.	13
00:21:53,078	00:21:56,172	 My name is Marlin. I'm a clownfish.	13
00:21:56,214	00:21:59,240	 A clownfish? Really? Tell us a joke.	13
00:21:59,284	00:22:01,013	 I love jokes.	13
00:22:01,053	00:22:04,045	 I actually do know one that's pretty good.	13
00:22:04,089	00:22:06,114	 There was this mollusk...	13
00:22:06,158	00:22:08,490	 and he walks up to a sea cucumber.	13
00:22:08,527	00:22:10,358	 Normally, they dont talk, sea cucumbers...	13
00:22:10,395	00:22:12,363	 but in a joke, everyone talks...	13
00:22:12,397	00:22:15,457	 so the sea mollusk says to the cucumber...	13
00:22:17,169	00:22:19,763	 Daddy!	13
00:22:19,805	00:22:21,136	 Nemo!	13
00:22:21,173	00:22:24,199	 Nemo! Ha ha! Nemo! I dont get it.	13
00:22:24,242	00:22:26,142	 For a clownfish, he's not that funny.	13
00:22:26,178	00:22:28,009	 No, no, no, no. He's my son.	13
00:22:28,046	00:22:30,105	 He was taken by these divers.	13
00:22:30,148	00:22:32,844	 Oh, my. You poor fish.	13
00:22:32,884	00:22:34,852	 Humans... think they own everything.	13
00:22:34,886	00:22:36,148	 Probably American.	13
00:22:36,188	00:22:37,189	 Now, there is a father... Looking for his little boy.	13
00:22:40,359	00:22:42,850	 What do these markings mean?	13
00:22:42,894	00:22:45,226	 I never knew my father!	13
00:22:45,263	00:22:47,663	 Group hug. We're all mates here, mate.	13
00:22:47,699	00:22:48,927	 I cant read human.	13
00:22:48,967	00:22:50,229	 We got to find a fish that can read this.	13
00:22:50,268	00:22:52,236	 Hey, look, sharks. No, no, no, Dory!	14
00:22:52,270	00:22:54,397	 Guys, guys. No, Dory.	14
00:22:54,439	00:22:55,770	 That's mine. Give it to me.	14
00:22:55,807	00:22:57,274	 Gimme! Ow!	14
00:22:57,309	00:22:59,277	 Oh, I'm sorry. Are you OK?	14
00:22:59,378	00:23:00,709	 Ow, ow, ow. I'm so sorry.	14
00:23:00,746	00:23:02,873	 You really clocked me there. Am I bleeding?	14
00:23:02,914	00:23:04,814	 Ohh. Ow, ow, ow.	14
00:23:04,850	00:23:08,411	 Dory, are you OK... Ohh.	14
00:23:08,453	00:23:09,254	 Ohh, that's good.	14
00:23:12,023	00:23:13,923	 Intervention!	14
00:23:13,959	00:23:16,553	 Just a bite. Hold it together, mate!	14
00:23:16,595	00:23:19,223	 Remember, Bruce, fish are friends, not food!	14
00:23:19,264	00:23:21,366	 Food! Dory, look out!	14
00:23:22,200	00:23:25,761	 Aah! I'm having fish tonight!	14
00:23:25,804	00:23:27,396	 Remember the steps, mate!	14
00:23:27,439	00:23:29,964	 Aah!	14
00:23:30,008	00:23:33,171	 Aah! Whoa! Aah!	14
00:23:33,211	00:23:35,475	 Just one bite! Aah!	14
00:23:38,550	00:23:42,316	 G'day. Grr!	14
00:23:43,355	00:23:44,617	 There's no way out!	14
00:23:44,656	00:23:46,419	 There's got to be a way to escape!	14
00:23:48,627	00:23:49,961	 Who is it?	14
00:23:49,961	00:23:51,326	 Dory, help me find a way out!	14
00:23:51,363	00:23:53,888	 Sorry. Come back later. We're trying to escape.	14
00:23:55,133	00:23:58,500	 There's got to be a way out! Here's something.	14
00:23:58,537	00:24:01,267	" ""Es-cap-e."" I wonder what that means."	14
00:24:01,306	00:24:02,830	" Funny. It's spelled just like ""escape."""	14
00:24:02,874	00:24:04,136	 Let's go. Aah!	14
00:24:04,176	00:24:07,270	 Here's Brucey!	14
00:24:07,312	00:24:09,007	 Wait a minute. You can read?	14
00:24:09,047	00:24:11,038	 I can read? That's right. I can read!	14
00:24:11,082	00:24:13,209	 Well, then, here. Read this now.	14
00:24:13,251	00:24:15,219	 Aah! Ohh!	14
00:24:15,253	00:24:18,017	 He really doesnt mean it. He never even knew his father.	14
00:24:18,056	00:24:19,284	 Don't fall off the wagon!	14
00:24:19,324	00:24:20,882	 Aah! Aah!	14
00:24:23,361	00:24:25,797	 Oh, no, it's blocked!	14
00:24:30,035	00:24:31,332	 No, Bruce, focus.	15
00:24:31,369	00:24:33,496	 Sorry about Bruce, mate.	15
00:24:33,538	00:24:36,200	 He's really a nice guy.	15
00:24:36,241	00:24:37,469	 I need to get that mask.	15
00:24:37,509	00:24:39,101	 You want that mask? OK.	15
00:24:39,144	00:24:41,908	 No, no, no, no, no, no!	15
00:24:41,947	00:24:44,472	 Quick, grab the mask!	15
00:24:48,854	00:24:51,186	 Oh, no. Bruce?	15
00:24:51,223	00:24:52,850	 What?	15
00:24:54,159	00:24:57,424	 Swim away! Swim away!	15
00:24:57,462	00:24:59,191	 Aw, is the party over?	15
00:25:08,540	00:25:10,474	 Nice.	15
00:25:13,569	00:25:14,729	 Dad?	15
00:25:17,573	00:25:18,767	 Daddy?	15
00:25:21,010	00:25:22,204	 Huh?	15
00:25:23,546	00:25:26,572	 Aah! Uhh!	15
00:25:29,085	00:25:30,279	 Uhh!	15
00:25:41,630	00:25:43,564	 Barbara. Uh-huh?	15
00:25:43,599	00:25:45,430	 Prep for his anterior crown, would you, please?	15
00:25:45,468	00:25:47,902	 And I'm going to need a few more cotton rolls.	15
00:25:47,937	00:25:49,564	 OK.	15
00:25:51,307	00:25:53,036	 Hello, little fella.	15
00:25:53,075	00:25:54,269	 Aah!	15
00:25:54,310	00:25:55,470	 Heh heh heh! Beauty, isn't he?	15
00:25:55,511	00:25:56,842	 I found that guy struggling for life...	15
00:25:56,879	00:25:58,574	 out on the reef, and I saved him.	15
00:25:58,614	00:26:00,707	 So, has that Novocaine kicked in yet?	15
00:26:00,750	00:26:03,947	 I think so. We're ready to roll.	15
00:26:05,187	00:26:06,711	 Bubbles!	15
00:26:09,692	00:26:11,284	 My bubbles.	16
00:26:11,327	00:26:12,692	 He likes bubbles.	16
00:26:12,728	00:26:16,425	 Aah! Ohh! No! Uhh!	16
00:26:24,206	00:26:25,434	 Bonjour. Aah!	16
00:26:25,474	00:26:29,274	 Slow down, little fella. There's nothing to worry about.	16
00:26:29,311	00:26:32,542	 He's scared to death. I want to go home.	16
00:26:32,581	00:26:34,606	 Do you know where my dad is?	16
00:26:34,650	00:26:37,414	 Honey, your dad's probably back at the pet store.	16
00:26:37,453	00:26:38,613	 Pet store?	16
00:26:38,654	00:26:41,350	 Yeah, you know, like, I'm from Bob's Fish Mart.	16
00:26:41,390	00:26:42,948	 Pet Palace. Fish-O-Rama.	16
00:26:42,992	00:26:44,459	 Mail order. Ebay.	16
00:26:44,493	00:26:47,189	 So, which one is it? I'm from the ocean.	16
00:26:47,229	00:26:49,163	 Ah, the ocean. The ocean?	16
00:26:49,198	00:26:51,098	 Aah! Aah! Aah!	16
00:26:51,133	00:26:53,829	 He hasn't been decontaminated. Jacques!	16
00:26:53,869	00:26:55,200	 Oui. Clean him!	16
00:26:55,237	00:26:56,761	 Oui.	16
00:26:56,806	00:26:59,240	 Ocean. Ooh, la mer. Bon.	16
00:27:01,076	00:27:03,203	 Voila. He is clean.	16
00:27:05,681	00:27:08,946	 Wow. The big blue. What's it like?	16
00:27:08,984	00:27:13,011	 Big and blue? I knew it.	16
00:27:13,055	00:27:16,252	 If there's anything you need, just ask your Auntie Deb.	16
00:27:16,292	00:27:19,386	 Or if I'm not around, you can talk to my sister Flo.	16
00:27:19,428	00:27:21,191	 Hi. How are you?	16
00:27:21,230	00:27:22,754	 Don't listen to anything my sister says.	16
00:27:22,798	00:27:24,629	 She's nuts. Ha ha ha ha!	16
00:27:24,667	00:27:25,759	 We got a live one.	16
00:27:25,801	00:27:28,827	 Can't hear you, Peach. I said we got a live one.	16
00:27:28,871	00:27:30,839	 Boy, oh, boy. What do we got?	16
00:27:30,873	00:27:32,397	 Root canal... and by the looks of those x-rays...	16
00:27:32,441	00:27:33,908	 it's not going to be pretty.	16
00:27:33,943	00:27:35,638	 Ow!	16
00:27:35,678	00:27:37,111	 Dam and clamp installed? Yep.	16
00:27:37,146	00:27:38,943	 What did he use to open? Gator-Glidden drill.	16
00:27:38,981	00:27:40,642	 He seems to favor that one lately.	16
00:27:40,683	00:27:43,618	 I cant see, Flo.	16
00:27:43,652	00:27:45,779	 You're getting a little too... Aah!	16
00:27:45,821	00:27:47,015	 Now he's doing the Schilder technique.	17
00:27:47,056	00:27:48,455	 He's using a Hedstrom file.	17
00:27:48,491	00:27:50,686	 That's not a Hedstrom file. That's a K-Flex.	17
00:27:50,726	00:27:53,354	 It has a teardrop cross-section. Clearly a Hedstrom.	17
00:27:53,395	00:27:54,885	 No, no, K-Flex. Hedstrom.	17
00:27:54,930	00:27:56,625	 K-Flex! Hedstrom!	17
00:27:56,665	00:27:58,724	 There I go. A little help, over here.	17
00:27:58,834	00:28:00,631	 I'll go deflate him.	17
00:28:03,072	00:28:05,233	 All right. Go ahead and rinse.	17
00:28:05,274	00:28:08,607	 Oh, the human mouth is a disgusting place.	17
00:28:11,046	00:28:12,980	 Hey, Nigel. What did I miss?	17
00:28:13,015	00:28:14,175	 Root canal... a doozy.	17
00:28:14,216	00:28:15,843	 Root canal? What did he use to open?	17
00:28:15,885	00:28:17,910	 Gator-Glidden drill. He's favoring that one.	17
00:28:17,953	00:28:20,945	 Hope he doesnt get surplus sealer at the portal terminus.	17
00:28:20,990	00:28:24,084	 Hello. Who's this? New guy. Ha ha ha!	17
00:28:24,126	00:28:25,457	 The dentist took him off the reef.	17
00:28:25,494	00:28:27,860	 An outie. From my neck of the woods, eh?	17
00:28:27,897	00:28:29,387	 Sorry if I ever took a snap at you.	17
00:28:29,431	00:28:30,830	 Fish gotta swim, birds gotta eat.	17
00:28:30,866	00:28:32,561	 Hey! No, no, no, no!	17
00:28:32,601	00:28:34,193	 They're not your fish. They're my fish.	17
00:28:34,236	00:28:37,034	 Come on, go. Go on, shoo!	17
00:28:38,374	00:28:40,035	 Aw, the picture broke.	17
00:28:40,075	00:28:42,134	 This here's Darla. She's my niece.	17
00:28:42,177	00:28:43,644	 She's going to be eight this week.	17
00:28:43,679	00:28:45,146	 Hey, little fella.	17
00:28:45,180	00:28:46,943	 Say hello to your new mummy.	17
00:28:46,982	00:28:49,450	 She'll be here Friday to pick you up.	17
00:28:49,485	00:28:51,316	 You're her present. Shh, shh, shh.	17
00:28:51,353	00:28:53,412	 It's our little secret.	17
00:28:53,455	00:28:54,979	 Well, Mr. Tucker, while that sets up...	17
00:28:55,024	00:28:56,992	 I'm going to see a man about a wallaby.	17
00:28:58,827	00:29:00,727	 Oh, Darla.	17
00:29:00,763	00:29:02,628	 What? What's wrong with her?	17
00:29:02,665	00:29:05,361	 She wouldnt stop shaking the bag.	17
00:29:05,401	00:29:09,167	 Poor Chuckles. He was her present last year.	17
00:29:09,204	00:29:11,570	 Hitched a ride on the porcelain express.	17
00:29:13,442	00:29:15,637	 She's a fish killer.	17
00:29:15,678	00:29:17,942	 I cant go with that girl.	17
00:29:17,980	00:29:19,743	 I have to get back to my dad.	17
00:29:19,782	00:29:23,684	 Aah! Daddy! Help me!	17
00:29:23,719	00:29:24,879	 Oh, he's stuck.	18
00:29:24,920	00:29:27,115	 Nobody touch him.	18
00:29:37,099	00:29:38,532	 Can you help me?	18
00:29:38,567	00:29:38,934	 No. You got yourself in there.	18
00:29:40,603	00:29:42,264	 You can get yourself out.	18
00:29:42,304	00:29:44,568	 Gill... I want to see him do it.	18
00:29:44,607	00:29:48,441	 Calm down. Alternate wiggling your fins and your tail.	18
00:29:48,477	00:29:51,275	 I cant. I have a bad fin.	18
00:29:51,313	00:29:53,474	 Never stopped me.	18
00:29:57,553	00:30:00,113	 Just think about what you need to do.	18
00:30:04,093	00:30:05,617	 Come on.	18
00:30:09,832	00:30:11,026	 Perfect.	18

00:30:12,468	00:30:14,231	 Good squirming. Ha ha ha!	18
00:30:14,269	00:30:17,864	 Wow. From the ocean... just like you, Gill.	18
00:30:17,906	00:30:19,066	 Yeah.	18
00:30:19,108	00:30:21,474	 I've seen that look before.	18
00:30:21,510	00:30:23,171	 What are you thinking about?	18
00:30:23,212	00:30:24,975	 I'm thinking...	18
00:30:25,014	00:30:28,575	 tonight, we give the kid a proper reception.	18
00:30:28,617	00:30:30,278	 So, kid, you got a name or what?	18

00:30:35,157	00:30:37,625	 Nemo. Nemo.	18
00:30:42,831	00:30:44,526	 Are you gonna eat that?	18
00:30:56,078	00:30:59,741	 Careful with that hammer. Huh?	18
00:31:02,251	00:31:05,015	 No, no.	19
00:31:05,054	00:31:07,284	 What does it say? Dory!	19
00:31:07,322	00:31:08,949	 A sea monkey has my money.	19
00:31:08,991	00:31:11,255	 Wake up. Get up. Come on.	19
00:31:11,293	00:31:12,260	 Come on!	19

00:32:03,612	00:32:04,840	 Hey, what you doing?	19
00:32:04,880	00:32:06,142	 It's gone. I've lost the mask.	19
00:32:06,181	00:32:08,206	 Did you drop it? You dropped it!	19
00:32:08,250	00:32:09,842	 That was my only chance of finding my son.	19
00:32:09,885	00:32:12,183	 Now it's gone.	19
00:32:14,790	00:32:18,658	 Hey, Mr. Grumpy Gills...	19

00:32:36,745	00:32:38,736	 See, I'm going to get stuck now with that song.	19
00:32:38,781	00:32:43,018	 Now it's in my head. Sorry.	20
00:32:43,018	00:32:44,451	 Dory, do you see anything?	20
00:32:44,486	00:32:46,215	 Aah! Something's got me. That was me. I'm sorry.	20
00:32:46,255	00:32:49,622	 Who's that? Who could it be? It's me.	20
00:32:49,658	00:32:52,923	 Are you my conscience?	20
00:32:52,961	00:32:55,589	 Yeah, yeah. I'm your conscience.	20
00:32:55,631	00:32:58,532	 We haven't spoken for a while. How are you?	20
00:32:58,567	00:33:00,831	 Can't complain. Yeah? Good.	20
00:33:00,869	00:33:02,598	 Now, Dory, I want you to tell me...	20
00:33:02,638	00:33:04,367	 Do you see anything?	20
00:33:04,406	00:33:08,001	 I see a... I see a light.	20
00:33:08,043	00:33:10,603	 A light? Yeah. Over there.	20
00:33:10,646	00:33:14,104	 Hey, conscience, am I dead? No. I see it, too.	20
00:33:21,790	00:33:23,781	 What is it?	20
00:33:23,826	00:33:28,627	 It's so pretty.	20
00:33:28,664	00:33:33,465	 I'm feeling... happy...	20
00:33:33,502	00:33:36,994	 which is a big deal for me.	20
00:33:37,039	00:33:38,529	 I want to touch it.	20
00:33:38,574	00:33:40,098	 Oh. Ooh.	20

00:38:05,707	00:38:07,334	 You said you could do it.	23
00:38:07,375	00:38:08,967	 The Ring of Fire!	23
00:38:11,346	00:38:13,473	 Bubbles, let me... Oh!	23
00:38:13,515	00:38:16,279	 Ha hwa ha ho ho ho	23

00:38:34,536	00:38:39,633	 From this moment on, you will be known as Sharkbait.	23
00:38:39,674	00:38:41,005	 Sharkbait, oo-ha-ha!	23
00:38:41,042	00:38:42,805	 Welcome, Brother Sharkbait.	23
00:38:42,844	00:38:44,072	 Sharkbait, oo-ha-ha!	23
00:38:44,112	00:38:46,137	 Enough with the Sharkbait. Sharkbait!	23
00:38:46,181	00:38:48,046	 Ooh... ba-ba-do.	23
00:38:48,083	00:38:49,641	 Sharkbait's one of us now, agreed?	23
00:38:49,684	00:38:51,743	 Agreed. We cant send him to his death.	23
00:38:51,786	00:38:53,879	 Darla's coming in five days.	23
00:38:53,922	00:38:55,480	 So, what are we going to do?	23
00:38:55,524	00:38:58,084	 I'll tell you what we're gonna do...	23
00:38:58,126	00:38:59,684	 we're gonna get him out of here.	23
00:38:59,728	00:39:02,253	 We'll help him escape. Escape? Really?	23
00:39:02,297	00:39:03,764	 We're all gonna escape.	23
00:39:03,798	00:39:06,426	 Gill, please. Not another escape plan.	23
00:39:06,468	00:39:08,493	 Sorry, but they just never work.	23
00:39:08,537	00:39:09,671	 Why should this be any different?	24
00:39:10,105	00:39:13,563	 Because we've got him. Me?	24
00:39:13,608	00:39:15,377	 You see that filter? Yeah.	24
00:39:15,377	00:39:18,813	 You're the only one who can get in and out of that thing.	24
00:39:18,847	00:39:22,010	 We need you to take a pebble inside there...	24
00:39:22,050	00:39:23,278	 and jam the gears.	24
00:39:23,318	00:39:25,286	 You do that, and this tank's gonna get...	24
00:39:25,320	00:39:27,288	 filthier and filthier by the minute.	24
00:39:27,322	00:39:29,654	 Pretty soon, the dentist'll have to clean the tank...	24
00:39:29,691	00:39:32,592	 and when he does, he'll take us out of the tank...	24
00:39:32,627	00:39:34,185	 put us in individual baggies...	24
00:39:34,229	00:39:36,026	 then we'll roll ourselves down the counter...	24
00:39:36,064	00:39:37,725	 out the window, off the awning...	24
00:39:37,766	00:39:39,427	 into the bushes, across the street...	24
00:39:39,467	00:39:41,935	 and into the harbor!	24
00:39:41,970	00:39:44,905	 It's foolproof. Who's with me?	24
00:39:44,940	00:39:46,339	 Aye! Aye!	24
00:39:46,374	00:39:47,807	 I think you're nuts.	24
00:39:48,977	00:39:51,810	 No offense, kid, but you're not the best swimmer.	24
00:39:51,846	00:39:54,246	 He's fine. He can do this.	24
00:39:54,282	00:39:57,740	 So, Sharkbait, what do you think?	24
00:39:57,786	00:40:02,724	 Let's do it.	24
00:40:02,724	00:40:05,693	 I'm going to P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.	24
00:40:05,727	00:40:07,024	 Where are you going?	24
00:40:07,062	00:40:08,723	 I'm going to P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.	24
00:40:08,763	00:40:10,390	 If you ask where I'm going...	24
00:40:10,432	00:40:12,161	 I'll tell you that's where I'm going.	24
00:40:12,200	00:40:13,667	 It's P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.	24
00:40:13,702	00:40:15,465	 Where? I'm sorry, I didnt hear you.	24
00:40:15,503	00:40:17,061	 P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.	24
00:40:17,105	00:40:19,903	 Excuse me.	24
00:40:19,941	00:40:21,738	 Hi. Do you know how to get...	24
00:40:21,776	00:40:24,745	 Hello? Whoa. Wait. Can you tell me...	24
00:40:24,779	00:40:29,113	 Hey! Hold it! I'm trying to talk to you!	24
00:40:29,150	00:40:32,517	 Fellas, come back here. One quick question.	24
00:40:32,554	00:40:36,957	 I need to... And they're gone again.	24
00:40:36,992	00:40:38,755	 P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.	24
00:40:38,793	00:40:40,454	 Why do I have to tell you over and over again?	24
00:40:40,495	00:40:42,486	 I'll tell you again. I dont get tired of it...	24
00:40:42,530	00:40:43,690	 OK, all right. Huh?	24
00:40:43,732	00:40:45,427	 Here's the thing. Uh-huh.	24
00:40:45,467	00:40:50,962	 I think it's best if I carry on from here by...	24
00:40:51,006	00:40:52,371	 by myself.	25
00:40:52,407	00:40:53,601	 OK.	25
00:40:53,642	00:40:55,337	 You know, alone. Uh-huh.	25
00:40:55,377	00:40:57,402	 Without... without... I mean, not without you.	25
00:40:57,445	00:41:00,812	 But I dont want you... with me.	25
00:41:00,849	00:41:03,181	 Huh? Am I...	25
00:41:03,218	00:41:04,378	 I dont want to hurt your feelings.	25
00:41:04,419	00:41:07,217	 You want me to leave? I mean, not... Yes.	25
00:41:07,255	00:41:09,689	 I just cant afford any more delays...	25
00:41:09,724	00:41:12,921	 and you're one of those fish that cause delays.	25
00:41:12,961	00:41:14,588	 Sometimes it's a good thing.	25
00:41:14,629	00:41:17,655	 There's a whole group of fish. They're delay fish.	25
00:41:17,699	00:41:19,257	 You mean...	25
00:41:19,301	00:41:20,962	 You mean you dont like me?	25
00:41:21,002	00:41:22,799	 No, of course I like you.	25
00:41:22,837	00:41:25,533	 It's because I like you I dont want to be with you.	25
00:41:25,573	00:41:27,734	 It's a complicated emotion.	25
00:41:27,776	00:41:31,473	 Ohh! Don't cry. I like you.	25
00:41:31,513	00:41:35,882	 Hey, you! Lady, is this guy bothering you?	25
00:41:35,917	00:41:37,851	 Um... I dont remember. Were you?	25
00:41:37,886	00:41:39,786	 No, no, no, no, no. We're just...	25
00:41:39,821	00:41:41,584	 Do you guys know how I can get to...	25
00:41:41,623	00:41:43,955	 Look, pal, we're talking to the lady, not you.	25
00:41:43,992	00:41:45,584	 Hey, hey. You like impressions?	25
00:41:45,627	00:41:47,652	 Mm-hmm.	25
00:41:47,696	00:41:50,028	 Just like in rehearsals, gentlemen.	25
00:41:50,065	00:41:51,623	 So what are we? Take a guess.	25
00:41:51,666	00:41:52,963	 Oh, oh. I've seen one of those.	25
00:41:53,001	00:41:55,196	 I'm a fish with a nose like a sword.	25
00:41:55,236	00:41:57,204	 Wait, wait, um... It's a swordfish!	25
00:41:57,238	00:41:59,007	 Hey, clown boy, let the lady guess.	25
00:42:00,308	00:42:01,866	 Where's the butter?	25
00:42:01,910	00:42:03,309	 Ooh! It's on the tip of my tongue!	25
00:42:03,345	00:42:05,336	 Lobster. Saw that!	25
00:42:05,380	00:42:07,211	 Lots of legs! Live in the ocean.	25
00:42:07,248	00:42:08,647	 Clam! Close enough!	25
00:42:08,683	00:42:10,173	 Oh, it's a whale of a tale	25
00:42:10,218	00:42:11,685	 I'll tell you, lad...	25
00:42:11,720	00:42:12,709	 They're good.	25
00:42:12,754	00:42:14,051	 Will somebody please give me directions?!	25
00:42:14,089	00:42:16,455	" ""Will somebody please give me directions?!"""	25
00:42:16,491	00:42:18,516	 Ha ha ha ha ha! I'm serious!	25
00:42:18,560	00:42:20,551	" ""Blah blah blah, me, me, blah!"	25
00:42:20,595	00:42:21,789	" ""Blah blah blah, me, me, me!"""	25
00:42:21,830	00:42:23,320	 Thank you.	25
00:42:23,365	00:42:25,856	 Oh, dear. Hey! Hey, come back!	25
00:42:25,900	00:42:28,036	 Hey, what's the matter? What's the matter?	26
00:42:28,603	00:42:30,571	 While they're doing their silly little impressions...	26
00:42:30,605	00:42:34,735	 I am miles from home with a fish that cant remember her name!	26
00:42:34,776	00:42:36,073	 I bet that's frustrating.	26
00:42:36,111	00:42:37,544	 Meanwhile, my son is out there.	26
00:42:37,579	00:42:39,570	 Your son Chico? Nemo?	26
00:42:39,614	00:42:41,013	 But it doesnt matter because no fish...	26
00:42:41,049	00:42:43,017	 in this entire ocean is going to help me.	26
00:42:43,051	00:42:46,817	 Well, I'm helping you.	26
00:42:46,855	00:42:48,186	 Wait right here.	26
00:42:49,424	00:42:52,018	 Guys! Is he bothering you again?	26
00:42:52,060	00:42:53,584	 No, no. He's a good guy.	26
00:42:53,628	00:42:54,629	 Go easy on him. He's lost his son Fabio.	26
00:42:55,897	00:42:58,764	 Any of you heard of P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?	26
00:42:58,867	00:43:01,495	 Sydney? Oh, sure!	26
00:43:01,536	00:43:03,265	 Ted here's got relatives in Sydney.	26
00:43:03,304	00:43:04,931	 Don't you, Ted? Sure do!	26
00:43:04,973	00:43:06,463	 Oh! Hey! They know Sydney!	26
00:43:07,709	00:43:09,199	 You wouldnt know how to get there, would you?	26
00:43:09,244	00:43:11,212	 You want to follow the E.A.C.	26
00:43:11,246	00:43:13,942	 That's the East Australian Current.	26
00:43:13,982	00:43:15,609	 Big current. Can't miss it.	26
00:43:15,650	00:43:18,619	 It's in... that direction.	26
00:43:18,653	00:43:20,553	 And then you follow that for about...	26
00:43:20,588	00:43:22,351	 I dont know. What do you guys think?	26
00:43:22,390	00:43:23,550	 About three leagues?	26
00:43:23,591	00:43:26,560	 That little baby will put you right past Sydney.	26
00:43:26,594	00:43:29,028	 Ta-da! That's great!	26
00:43:29,063	00:43:30,257	 Dory, you did it!	26
00:43:30,298	00:43:32,129	 Oh, please, I'm just your little helper.	26
00:43:32,167	00:43:34,499	 Helping along. That's me. Fellas, thank you.	26
00:43:34,536	00:43:38,165	 Don't mention it! Just loosen up, OK, buddy?	26
00:43:38,206	00:43:41,198	 Oh, you guys. You really nailed him. Bye.	26
00:43:41,242	00:43:43,073	 Oh, hey, ma'am. One more thing.	26
00:43:43,111	00:43:46,672	 When you come to this trench, swim through it, not over it.	26
00:43:46,714	00:43:48,614	 Trench... through it, not over it.	26
00:43:48,650	00:43:51,346	 I'll remember. Hey, hey!	26
00:43:52,787	00:43:55,051	 Hey, wait up, partner! Hold on!	26
00:43:55,089	00:43:57,819	 Wait, wait, wait! I gotta tell you something.	26
00:43:57,859	00:44:00,555	 Whoa.	26
00:44:00,595	00:44:02,893	 Nice trench.	26
00:44:04,632	00:44:07,624	 Hello!	27
00:44:10,338	00:44:12,966	 OK, let's go. No, no. Bad trench.	27
00:44:13,007	00:44:14,668	 Come on, we'll swim over this thing.	27
00:44:14,709	00:44:16,836	 Whoa, partner. Little red flag going up.	27
00:44:16,878	00:44:20,507	 Something's telling me to swim through it, not over it.	27
00:44:20,548	00:44:22,175	 Are you looking at this thing?	27
00:44:22,217	00:44:23,707	 It's got death written all over it.	27
00:44:23,751	00:44:26,584	 I really, really, really think we should swim through.	27
00:44:26,621	00:44:28,851	 And I'm really, really done talking about this. Over we go.	27
00:44:28,890	00:44:30,858	 Trust me on this. Trust you?	27
00:44:30,892	00:44:32,757	 Yes, trust. It's what friends do.	27
00:44:32,794	00:44:34,694	 Look! Something shiny!	27
00:44:34,729	00:44:36,492	 Where? It just swam over the trench.	27
00:44:36,531	00:44:42,237	 Come on, we'll follow it! OK!	27
00:44:42,237	00:44:44,899	 Boy, it sure is clear up here.	27
00:44:44,939	00:44:48,397	 Exactly. And look at that... there's the current.	27
00:44:48,443	00:44:51,037	 We should be there in no time.	27
00:44:51,079	00:44:52,876	 Hey, little guy.	27
00:44:52,914	00:44:54,677	 You wanted to go through the trench.	27
00:44:54,716	00:44:56,741	 I shall call him Squishy, and he shall be mine.	27
00:44:56,784	00:44:58,945	 And he shall be my Squishy. Come here, Squishy.	27
00:44:59,053	00:45:00,486	 Come here, little Squishy.	27
00:45:02,290	00:45:03,518	 Ow!	27
00:45:03,558	00:45:06,425	 That's a jellyfish! Bad Squishy!	27
00:45:06,461	00:45:08,258	 Shoo, shoo! Get away!	27
00:45:08,296	00:45:10,594	 Let me see that. Don't touch it.	27
00:45:10,632	00:45:12,964	 I wont touch it. I just want to look.	27
00:45:13,001	00:45:15,026	 Hey! How come it didnt sting you?	27
00:45:15,069	00:45:16,593	 It did. It's just that...	27
00:45:16,638	00:45:18,333	 Ow! Ow! Ow! Hold still.	27
00:45:18,373	00:45:19,840	 I live in this anemone...	27
00:45:19,874	00:45:21,739	 and I'm used to these kind of stings.	27
00:45:21,776	00:45:22,936	 Ow! Ow! Ow!	27
00:45:22,977	00:45:24,968	 It doesnt look bad. You'll be fine.	27
00:45:25,013	00:45:26,742	 But now we know, dont we...	27
00:45:26,781	00:45:28,976	 that we dont want to touch these again.	27
00:45:29,017	00:45:32,043	 Let's be thankful this time it was just a little one.	27
00:45:32,086	00:45:34,486	 Aah! Aah!	27
00:45:34,522	00:45:35,784	 Don't move.	27
00:45:37,625	00:45:38,426	 This is bad, Dory. Hey, watch this!	27
00:45:40,562	00:45:42,223	 Boing! Boing!	28
00:45:42,263	00:45:43,491	 Dory!	28
00:45:43,531	00:45:45,863	 You cant catch me	28
00:45:45,900	00:45:47,367	 Don't bounce on the tops!	28
00:45:47,402	00:45:50,530	 They will... not sting you!	28
00:45:50,572	00:45:53,234	 The tops dont sting you! Two in a row! Beat that!	28
00:45:53,274	00:45:56,209	 Dory, listen to me. I have an idea... a game.	28
00:45:56,244	00:45:57,711	 A game? Yes.	28
00:45:57,812	00:46:00,474	 I love games! Pick me! Here's the game.	28
00:46:00,515	00:46:03,973	 Whoever can hop the fastest out of these jellyfish wins!	28
00:46:04,018	00:46:05,645	 OK. Rules, rules, rules!	28
00:46:05,687	00:46:08,247	 You cant touch the tentacles. Only the tops.	28
00:46:08,289	00:46:10,154	 Something about tentacles. Got it. Go!	28
00:46:10,191	00:46:13,126	 Wait! Not something about 'em, it's all about 'em!	28
00:46:13,161	00:46:14,355	 Whee! Wait, Dory!	28
00:46:14,395	00:46:15,096	 Gotta go faster if you want to win!	28
00:46:16,531	00:46:17,691	 Whoa! Dory!	28
00:46:17,732	00:46:19,700	 Boing, boing, boing!	28
00:46:19,734	00:46:22,601	 Wait a minute! Whoa! Dory!	28
00:46:22,637	00:46:24,161	 Whee!	28
00:46:24,205	00:46:27,470	 We're cheating death now. That's what we're doing.	28
00:46:27,508	00:46:29,169	 But we're having fun at the same time.	28
00:46:29,210	00:46:30,643	 I can do this. Just be careful.	28
00:46:30,678	00:46:32,578	 Yeah, careful I dont make you cry when I win!	28
00:46:32,614	00:46:33,774	 I dont think so!	28
00:46:33,815	00:46:35,339	 Ha ha ha ha!	28
00:46:35,383	00:46:37,180	 Whoa!	28
00:46:37,218	00:46:38,378	 Give it up, old man.	28
00:46:38,419	00:46:40,683	 You cant fight evolution. I was built for speed.	28
00:46:40,722	00:46:42,690	 The question is, Dory, are you hungry?	28
00:46:42,724	00:46:44,055	 Hungry? Yeah.	28
00:46:44,092	00:46:46,822	 'Cause you're about to eat my bubbles!	28
00:46:46,861	00:46:49,022	 Duck to the left! Right there!	28
00:46:51,399	00:46:53,833	 The clownfish is the winner!	28
00:46:53,868	00:46:56,928	 Whoo-hoo! We did it! Look at us!	28
00:46:56,971	00:46:58,498	 Dory?	28
00:47:00,733	00:47:02,132	 Oh, no.	28
00:47:03,202	00:47:05,500	 Dory! Dory!	28
00:47:05,538	00:47:07,631	 Dory!	28
00:47:11,878	00:47:13,709	 Ohh!	28
00:47:16,015	00:47:18,745	 Am I disqualified?	28
00:47:18,784	00:47:20,752	 No, you're doing fine! You're actually winning!	29
00:47:20,786	00:47:23,914	 But you gotta stay awake. Where does P. Sherman live?	29
00:47:23,956	00:47:26,857	 P. Sherman... Wallaby Way, Sydney...	29
00:47:26,893	00:47:28,656	 That's it!	29
00:47:28,694	00:47:29,854	 Uhh!	29
00:47:29,896	00:47:32,592	 Wallaby Way... Uhh! Stay awake!	29
00:47:32,632	00:47:34,930	 Stay awake! Ooh! Stay awake!	29
00:47:34,967	00:47:38,733	 Stay... awake!	29
00:47:41,274	00:47:44,539	 Awake. P. Sherman.	29
00:47:44,577	00:47:47,569	 Awake. 42 Wallaby Way.	29
00:47:47,613	00:47:51,183	 Wake up. Nemo...	29
00:48:06,299	00:48:08,665	 You miss your dad, dont you, Sharkbait?	29
00:48:08,701	00:48:09,569	 Yeah.	29
00:48:10,102	00:48:14,095	 You're lucky to have someone out there looking for you.	29
00:48:14,140	00:48:16,301	 He's not looking for me.	29
00:48:16,342	00:48:19,709	 He's scared of the ocean.	29
00:48:19,745	00:48:21,303	 Peach, any movement?	29
00:48:21,380	00:48:24,281	 He's had four cups of coffee. It's gotta be soon.	29
00:48:24,317	00:48:25,841	 Keep on him.	29
00:48:28,254	00:48:31,087	 My first escape... landed on dental tools.	29
00:48:31,123	00:48:32,556	 I was aiming for the toilet.	29
00:48:32,592	00:48:33,786	 Toilet?	29
00:48:33,826	00:48:36,420	 All drains lead to the ocean, kid.	29
00:48:36,462	00:48:39,727	 Wow. How many times have you tried to get out?	29
00:48:39,765	00:48:41,357	 Ah, I've lost count.	29
00:48:41,400	00:48:43,334	 Fish aren't meant to be in a box, kid.	29
00:48:43,369	00:48:45,030	 It does things to you.	29
00:48:45,071	00:48:47,198	 Bubbles! Bubbles!	29
00:48:47,239	00:48:49,605	" Potty break! He grabbed the ""Reader's Digest."""	29
00:48:49,642	00:48:53,043	 We have 4.2 minutes! That's your cue, Sharkbait.	29
00:48:53,079	00:48:55,377	 You can do it, kid. We gotta be quick.	29
00:48:55,414	00:48:55,615	 Once you get in, swim to the bottom of the chamber...	30
00:48:58,084	00:48:59,847	 and I'll talk you through the rest.	30
00:48:59,885	00:49:02,683	 OK. It'll be a piece of kelp.	30
00:49:11,130	00:49:12,495	 Nicely done!	30
00:49:12,531	00:49:14,260	 Can you hear me? Yeah!	30
00:49:14,300	00:49:16,791	 Here comes the pebble.	30
00:49:18,070	00:49:19,264	 Ptoo.	30
00:49:21,741	00:49:24,539	 Now, do you see a small opening?	30
00:49:24,577	00:49:26,010	 Uh-huh!	30
00:49:26,045	00:49:29,208	 Inside it, you'll see a rotating fan.	30
00:49:29,248	00:49:33,776	 Wedge that pebble into the fan to stop it turning.	30
00:49:37,189	00:49:38,486	 Aah!	30
00:49:38,524	00:49:40,822	 Careful, Sharkbait! I cant do it!	30
00:49:40,860	00:49:42,384	 Gill, this isn't a good idea.	30
00:49:42,428	00:49:44,191	 He'll be fine. Try again!	30
00:49:44,230	00:49:46,926	 OK.	30
00:49:46,966	00:49:49,434	 That's it, Sharkbait.	30
00:49:49,468	00:49:51,766	 Nice and steady.	30
00:49:54,240	00:49:55,798	 I got it! I got it!	30
00:49:55,841	00:49:58,571	 He did it! That's great, kid!	30
00:49:58,611	00:50:00,806	 Now swim up the tube and out.	30
00:50:18,097	00:50:20,827	 Oh, no! Gill!	30
00:50:20,866	00:50:22,060	 Sharkbait! Oh, my gosh!	30
00:50:22,101	00:50:23,329	 Get him outta there!	30
00:50:23,369	00:50:25,894	 What do we do? Oh, no!	30
00:50:25,938	00:50:27,906	 Stay calm, kid. Just dont panic!	30
00:50:28,941	00:50:30,340	 Help me!	30
00:50:30,376	00:50:32,742	 Sharkbait, grab hold of this!	30
00:50:36,248	00:50:38,216	 No! No! No! Feed me more!	31
00:50:38,250	00:50:41,185	 That's it! Sharkbait! Grab it!	31
00:50:41,220	00:50:43,916	 I got it!	31
00:50:43,956	00:50:45,753	 Pull!	31
00:50:52,431	00:50:55,127	 Gill, dont make him go back in there.	31
00:50:56,368	00:51:00,395	 No. We're done.	31
00:51:13,452	00:51:15,147	 Dude.	31
00:51:15,187	00:51:18,247	 Uhh. Dude.	31
00:51:18,290	00:51:22,784	 Focus, dude. Dude.	31
00:51:22,828	00:51:24,455	 Ohh.	31
00:51:24,497	00:51:26,089	 Oh, he lives. Hey, dude!	31
00:51:26,132	00:51:29,499	 Ohh. What happened?	31
00:51:29,535	00:51:31,594	 Saw the whole thing, dude.	31
00:51:31,637	00:51:33,502	" First, you were all, like, ""Whoa!""..."	31
00:51:33,539	00:51:35,166	" and then we were all, like, ""Whoa!""..."	31
00:51:35,207	00:51:37,107	" and then you were, like, ""Whoa."""	31
00:51:37,143	00:51:38,576	 What are you talking about?	31
00:51:38,611	00:51:42,047	 You, mini-man. Takin' on the jellies.	31
00:51:42,081	00:51:44,914	 You got serious thrill issues, dude.	31
00:51:44,950	00:51:46,212	 Ohh. Awesome.	31
00:51:46,252	00:51:49,449	 Uhh. Oh, my stomach. Ohh!	31
00:51:49,488	00:51:51,456	 Oh, man. No hurlin' on the shell, dude, OK?	31
00:51:51,490	00:51:52,684	 Just waxed it.	31
00:51:52,725	00:51:54,955	 So, Mr. Turtle...	31
00:51:54,994	00:51:57,360	 Whoa, dude. Mr. Turtle is my father.	31
00:51:57,396	00:51:58,829	 The name's Crush.	31
00:51:58,864	00:52:01,196	 Crush? Really?	31
00:52:01,233	00:52:05,897	 OK, Crush. I need to the East Australian Current.	31
00:52:05,938	00:52:07,166	 E.A.C.?	31
00:52:07,206	00:52:09,140	 Oh, dude.	31
00:52:09,175	00:52:11,541	 You're ridin' it, dude!	31
00:52:11,577	00:52:14,205	 Check it out!	32
00:52:35,134	00:52:36,999	 OK, grab shell, dude!	32
00:52:37,036	00:52:38,804	 Grab wh-a-a-at?!	32
00:52:48,180	00:52:50,842	 Ha ha! Righteous! Righteous!	32
00:52:50,883	00:52:55,621	 Yeah! Stop!	32
00:52:55,621	00:52:58,089	 So...	32
00:52:58,123	00:53:01,650	 What brings you on this fine day to the E.A.C.?	32
00:53:01,694	00:53:04,288	 Dory and I need to get to Sydney.	32
00:53:04,330	00:53:06,560	 Dory! Is she all right?	32
00:53:06,599	00:53:08,396	 Huh? Oh, little blue.	32
00:53:09,501	00:53:11,093	 She is sub-level, dude.	32
00:53:15,241	00:53:17,801	 Dory! Dory! Dory!	32
00:53:17,843	00:53:19,572	 Dory.	32
00:53:21,313	00:53:24,146	 I'm so sorry.	32
00:53:24,183	00:53:27,516	 This is all my fault. It's my fault.	32
00:53:27,553	00:53:32,524	 Twenty-nine, thirty! Ready or not, here I come!	32
00:53:32,524	00:53:34,549	 There you are!	32
00:53:35,828	00:53:38,695	 Catch me if you can!	32
00:53:38,731	00:53:41,097	 Dory?	32
00:53:41,133	00:53:42,964	 Nice wave!	32
00:53:43,002	00:53:45,027	 Oh, wow!	32
00:53:45,070	00:53:46,731	 Heh heh.	32
00:53:46,772	00:53:47,206	 Up you go!	32
00:53:48,641	00:53:51,633	 Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!	32
00:53:51,677	00:53:53,110	 Whoa! Whoa!	33
00:53:54,413	00:53:56,745	 Whoa-oh-oh-oh!	33
00:53:58,651	00:54:01,245	 Oh, my goodness! Kill the motor, dude.	33
00:54:01,287	00:54:04,620	 Let us see what Squirt does flying solo.	33
00:54:10,362	00:54:13,058	 Whoa!	33
00:54:13,098	00:54:16,090	 Whoa! That was so cool!	33
00:54:16,135	00:54:17,932	 Hey, Dad, did you see that?	33
00:54:17,970	00:54:20,302	 Did you see me? Did you see what I did?	33
00:54:20,339	00:54:23,308	 You so totally rock, Squirt!	33
00:54:23,342	00:54:24,866	 So give me some fin.	33
00:54:24,910	00:54:26,309	 Noggin.	33
00:54:26,345	00:54:27,710	 Dude. Dude.	33
00:54:27,746	00:54:29,145	 Oh... intro.	33
00:54:29,181	00:54:31,081	 Jellyman, offspring.	33
00:54:31,116	00:54:33,175	 Offspring, Jellyman.	33
00:54:33,218	00:54:36,745	 Jellies?! Sweet. Totally.	33
00:54:36,789	00:54:40,020	 Apparently, I must've done something you liked... dudes.	33
00:54:40,059	00:54:42,493	 You rock, dude! Ow.	33
00:54:42,528	00:54:47,261	 Curl away, my son. It's awesome, Jellyman.	33
00:54:47,299	00:54:48,960	 The little dudes are just eggs.	33
00:54:49,001	00:54:50,764	 We leave 'em on a beach to hatch...	33
00:54:50,803	00:54:52,065	 and then, coo-coo-cachoo...	33
00:54:52,104	00:54:54,504	 they find their way back to the big ol' blue.	33
00:54:54,540	00:54:56,872	 All by themselves? Yeah.	33
00:54:56,909	00:54:59,901	 But, dude, how do you know when they're ready?	33
00:54:59,945	00:55:01,173	 Well, you never really know.	33
00:55:01,213	00:55:04,614	 But when they know, you'll know, you know? Ha.	33
00:55:08,854	00:55:10,287	 Hey, look, everybody.	33
00:55:10,322	00:55:13,018	 I know that dude! It's the Jellyman!	33
00:55:13,058	00:55:15,083	 Go on. Jump on him!	33
00:55:15,127	00:55:18,324	 Turtle pile! Wait, wait, wait!	33
00:55:18,364	00:55:20,423	 Are you funny? Where's your shell?	33
00:55:20,466	00:55:22,525	 I need to breathe! Are you running away?	33
00:55:22,568	00:55:24,229	 Did you really cross the jellyfish forest?	33
00:55:24,269	00:55:26,237	 Did they sting you? One at a time!	33
00:55:26,271	00:55:27,932	 Mr. Fish, did you die?	33
00:55:27,973	00:55:30,498	 Sorry, I was a little vague on the details.	34
00:55:30,542	00:55:31,702	 So, where are you going?	34
00:55:31,744	00:55:33,609	 You see, my son was taken.	34
00:55:33,645	00:55:36,478	 My son was taken away from me.	34
00:55:36,515	00:55:38,779	 No way. What happened?	34
00:55:38,817	00:55:40,978	 No, no, kids. I dont want to talk about it.	34
00:55:41,020	00:55:43,352	 Aww! Please?	34
00:55:43,389	00:55:44,720	 Please?	34
00:55:44,757	00:55:47,493	 Well, OK.	34
00:55:47,493	00:55:51,327	 I live on this reef a long, long way from here.	34
00:55:51,363	00:55:53,388	 This is gonna be good. I can tell.	34
00:55:53,432	00:55:55,832	 And my son Nemo...	34
00:55:55,868	00:55:57,836	 See, he was mad at me.	34
00:55:57,870	00:55:59,497	 And maybe he wouldnt have done it...	34
00:55:59,538	00:56:01,028	 if I hadn't been so tough on him.	34
00:56:01,073	00:56:02,301	 I dont know.	34
00:56:02,341	00:56:04,332	 Anyway, he swam out in the open water to this boat...	34
00:56:04,376	00:56:07,243	 and when he was out there, these divers appeared...	34
00:56:07,279	00:56:09,907	 and I tried to stop them, but the boat was too fast.	34
00:56:09,948	00:56:11,711	 So, we swam out in the ocean to follow them...	34
00:56:11,750	00:56:14,082	 They couldnt stop 'em. And then Nemo's dad...	34
00:56:14,119	00:56:16,883	 he swims out to the ocean, and they bump into...	34
00:56:16,922	00:56:18,219	 ...three ferocious sharks.	34
00:56:18,257	00:56:20,350	 He scares away the sharks by blowing 'em up!	34
00:56:20,392	00:56:21,723	 Golly, that's amazing.	34
00:56:21,760	00:56:23,387	 And then dives thousands of feet...	34
00:56:23,429	00:56:25,158	 ...straight down into the dark.	34
00:56:25,197	00:56:26,664	 It's wicked dark down there.	34
00:56:26,698	00:56:28,393	 You cant see a thing. How's it going, Bob?	34
00:56:28,434	00:56:30,095	 And the only thing they can see down there...	34
00:56:30,135	00:56:31,864	 ...is the light from this big, horrible creature...	34
00:56:31,904	00:56:33,872	 with razor-sharp teeth. Nice parry, old man.	34
00:56:33,906	00:56:35,271	 And then he has to blast his way...	34
00:56:35,307	00:56:36,934	 So, these two little fish have been...	34
00:56:36,975	00:56:40,512	 searching the ocean for days on the East Australian Current.	34
00:56:40,512	00:56:42,844	 Which means that he may be on his way here right now.	34
00:56:42,881	00:56:44,405	 That should put him in Sydney Harbor...	34
00:56:44,450	00:56:45,747	 ...in a matter of days. I mean, it sounds like...	34
00:56:45,784	00:56:47,775	 this guy is gonna stop at nothing...	34
00:56:47,820	00:56:50,584	 ...till he finds his son. I sure hope he makes it.	34
00:56:50,622	00:56:53,614	 That's one dedicated father, if you ask me.	34
00:56:59,231	00:57:01,165	 Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!	34
00:57:01,200	00:57:06,502	 Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!	34
00:57:08,273	00:57:11,674	 Would you just shut up?!	35
00:57:11,710	00:57:13,177	 You're rats with wings!	35
00:57:13,212	00:57:14,702	 Bloke's been looking for his boy Nemo.	35
00:57:14,746	00:57:17,078	 Nemo?! He was taken off the reef...	35
00:57:17,116	00:57:20,142	 Take it! You happy? Mine! Mine! Mine!	35
00:57:20,185	00:57:22,983	 Hey, say that again! Something about Nemo.	35
00:57:23,021	00:57:24,181	 Mine! Mine! Mine!	35
00:57:24,223	00:57:25,713	 Whoooa...	35
00:57:25,757	00:57:26,917	 Hyah!	35
00:57:26,959	00:57:28,517	 Mine?	35
00:57:28,560	00:57:30,790	 Last I heard, he's heading towards the harbor.	35
00:57:30,829	00:57:33,263	 Ho ho! Brilliant!	35
00:57:46,145	00:57:47,646	 Is he doing OK?	35
00:57:48,213	00:57:51,410	 Whatever you do, Don't mention D-a-r...	35
00:57:51,450	00:57:54,317	 It's OK. I know who you're talking about.	35
00:58:02,327	00:58:03,658	 Gill?	35
00:58:07,900	00:58:10,562	 Hey, Sharkbait.	35
00:58:10,602	00:58:12,832	 I'm sorry I couldnt stop the...	35
00:58:12,871	00:58:15,032	 No, I'm the one who should be sorry.	35
00:58:15,073	00:58:17,701	 I was so ready to get out...	35
00:58:17,743	00:58:20,507	 so ready to taste that ocean...	35
00:58:20,546	00:58:23,982	 I was willing to put you in harm's way to get there.	35
00:58:24,016	00:58:27,975	 Nothing should be worth that.	35
00:58:28,020	00:58:31,251	 I'm sorry I couldnt get you back to your father, kid.	35
00:58:34,960	00:58:37,861	 All right. Hey, hey, hey...	35
00:58:37,896	00:58:39,523	 What the... Aaah!	35
00:58:39,565	00:58:43,296	 That's one way to pull a tooth.	35
00:58:43,335	00:58:45,428	 Huh. Darn kids.	36
00:58:45,470	00:58:48,462	 Good thing I pulled the right one, eh, Prime Minister?	36
00:58:48,507	00:58:50,065	 Hey, psst!	36
00:58:50,108	00:58:52,099	 Oh, Nigel! You just missed an extraction.	36
00:58:52,144	00:58:54,772	 Has he loosened the periodontal ligament yet?	36
00:58:54,813	00:58:56,872	 What am I talking about? Where's Nemo?	36
00:58:56,982	00:58:59,246	 I've got to speak with him. What is it?	36
00:58:59,284	00:59:01,377	 Your dad's been fighting the entire ocean...	36
00:59:01,420	00:59:04,048	 Iooking for you. My father? Really?	36
00:59:04,089	00:59:08,219	 He's traveled hundreds of miles, battling sharks and jellyfish...	36
00:59:08,260	00:59:10,751	 Sharks? That cant be him.	36
00:59:10,796	00:59:13,390	 What was his name? Some sort of sport fish.	36
00:59:13,432	00:59:15,593	 Tuna? Trout? Marlin?	36
00:59:15,634	00:59:17,465	 Marlin! The little clownfish from the reef.	36
00:59:17,502	00:59:20,096	 It's my dad! He took on a shark!	36
00:59:20,138	00:59:22,470	 I heard he took on three.	36
00:59:22,507	00:59:25,340	 Three sharks? That's 4,800 teeth!	36
00:59:25,377	00:59:27,470	 After you were taken by Diver Dan over there...	36
00:59:27,512	00:59:29,742	 your dad followed the boat like a maniac.	36
00:59:29,781	00:59:31,146	 Really?	36
00:59:31,183	00:59:32,980	 He's swimming, giving it all he's got...	36
00:59:33,018	00:59:35,077	 and then three gigantic sharks capture him...	36
00:59:35,120	00:59:37,384	 and he blows them up and dives thousands of feet...	36
00:59:37,422	00:59:40,255	 and gets chased by a monster with huge teeth!	36
00:59:40,292	00:59:42,920	 He ties this demon to a rock, and what's his reward?	36
00:59:42,961	00:59:45,327	 He gets to battle an entire jellyfish forest!	36
00:59:45,364	00:59:48,561	 Now he's with a bunch of sea turtles on the E.A. C...	36
00:59:48,600	00:59:52,092	 and the word is he's headed this way right now... to Sydney!	36
00:59:52,137	00:59:53,502	 Wow! What a good daddy!	36
00:59:53,538	00:59:56,098	 He was looking for you after all, Sharkbait.	36
00:59:59,611	01:00:01,238	 He's swimming to the filter!	36
01:00:01,280	01:00:02,770	 Sharkbait! Not again!	36
01:00:04,316	01:00:07,251	 Sharkbait!	36
01:00:07,286	01:00:08,651	 No!	36
01:00:08,687	01:00:09,881	 You got your whole life ahead of you!	36
01:00:09,921	01:00:12,321	 We'll help you, kid! Get him out!	36
01:00:16,628	01:00:18,289	 Get him out of there!	36
01:00:18,330	01:00:19,957	 Come on, kid! Grab the end!	36
01:00:19,998	01:00:22,592	 Sharkbait!	36
01:00:22,634	01:00:24,659	 No! Can you hear me?	37
01:00:24,703	01:00:26,193	 Nemo! Can you hear me?	37
01:00:26,238	01:00:28,263	 Yeah, I can hear you.	37
01:00:28,307	01:00:30,241	 Sharkbait, you did it!	37
01:00:30,275	01:00:34,075	 Sharkbait, you're... covered with germs! Aah!	37
01:00:34,112	01:00:36,181	 Ha ha! That took guts, kid.	37
01:00:36,181	01:00:38,672	 All right, gang, we have less than 48 hours...	37
01:00:38,717	01:00:40,014	 before Darla gets here.	37
01:00:40,052	01:00:41,747	 This tank'll get plenty dirty in that time...	37
01:00:41,787	01:00:44,620	 but we have to help it along any way we can.	37
01:00:44,656	01:00:46,920	 Jacques? No cleaning. I shall resist.	37
01:00:46,958	01:00:49,620	 Everybody else, be as gross as possible.	37
01:00:49,661	01:00:50,889	 Think dirty thoughts.	37
01:00:50,929	01:00:53,124	 We're gonna make this tank so filthy...	37
01:00:53,165	01:00:55,690	 the dentist will have to clean it.	37
01:00:55,734	01:00:57,827	 Good work! Ha ha ha!	37
01:01:04,376	01:01:06,901	 All right, we're here, dudes!	37
01:01:06,945	01:01:10,142	 Get ready! Your exit's coming up, man!	37
01:01:10,182	01:01:11,672	 Where? I dont see it!	37
01:01:11,717	01:01:14,151	 Right there! I see it! I see it!	37
01:01:14,186	01:01:17,314	 The swirling vortex of terror?	37
01:01:17,356	01:01:19,654	 That's it, dude. Of course it is.	37
01:01:19,691	01:01:23,718	 OK, first, find your exit buddy.	37
01:01:23,762	01:01:26,253	 Do you have your exit buddy?	37
01:01:26,298	01:01:27,526	 Yes!	37
01:01:27,566	01:01:32,299	 Squirt give you a rundown of proper exiting technique.	37
01:01:32,337	01:01:35,864	 Good afternoon! We'll have a great jump today!	37
01:01:35,907	01:01:39,604	 OK, crank a hard cutback as you hit the wall.	37
01:01:39,644	01:01:42,579	 There's a screaming bottom turn, so watch out!	37
01:01:42,614	01:01:45,879	 Remember... rip it, roll it, and punch it!	37
01:01:45,917	01:01:49,045	 He's trying to speak to me, I know it!	37
01:01:49,087	01:01:52,318	 You're really cute, but I dont know what you're saying!	37
01:01:52,357	01:01:53,619	 Say the first thing again.	37
01:01:53,658	01:01:56,183	 OK, Jellyman! Go, go, go!	37
01:02:01,433	01:02:04,960	 Whoa! Wahoo!	38
01:02:05,003	01:02:07,062	 Whoa! Whoa!	38
01:02:09,107	01:02:10,506	 Whoo!	38
01:02:10,542	01:02:13,136	 That was... fun!	38
01:02:13,178	01:02:15,442	 I actually enjoyed that.	38
01:02:15,480	01:02:17,107	 Hey, look, turtles!	38
01:02:17,149	01:02:20,084	 Ha ha! Most excellent!	38
01:02:20,118	01:02:21,881	 Now turn your fishy tails around...	38
01:02:21,920	01:02:25,117	 and swim straight on through to Sydney!	38
01:02:25,157	01:02:27,318	 No worries, man!	38
01:02:27,359	01:02:29,418	 No worries! Thank you, dude Crush!	38
01:02:29,461	01:02:32,021	 Bye! Bye, Jellyman!	38
01:02:32,063	01:02:34,361	 You tell your little dude I said hi, OK?	38
01:02:34,399	01:02:35,559	 See ya later, dudes!	38
01:02:35,600	01:02:37,329	 Bye, everyone!	38
01:02:37,369	01:02:39,701	 Nemo would have loved this.	38
01:02:39,738	01:02:43,071	 Ooh! Hey! Crush, I forgot!	38
01:02:43,108	01:02:44,666	 How old are you?	38
01:02:44,709	01:02:48,907	 150, dude! And still young! Rock on!	38
01:02:48,947	01:02:52,974	 150! 150! I gotta remember that.	38
01:02:53,018	01:02:54,212	 Whoa.	38
01:02:59,024	01:03:01,652	 We going in there? Yep.	38
01:03:01,693	01:03:03,752	 P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?	38
01:03:03,795	01:03:09,427	 Yep. We're gonna just swim straight.	38
01:03:09,468	01:03:12,232	 Just keep swimming, just keep swimming	38
01:03:12,270	01:03:13,430	 Dory...	38
01:03:22,214	01:03:24,842	 Boy, this is taking awhile.	38
01:03:24,883	01:03:26,578	 How about we play a game?	38
01:03:26,618	01:03:27,880	 OK.	38
01:03:27,919	01:03:30,979	 OK, I'm thinking of something orange...	38
01:03:31,022	01:03:32,512	 and it's small...	38
01:03:32,557	01:03:34,855	 It's me. Right!	38
01:03:34,893	01:03:38,454	 It's orange and small...	38
01:03:38,497	01:03:39,794	 It's me.	39
01:03:39,831	01:03:41,731	 All righty, Mr. Smartypants.	39
01:03:41,766	01:03:42,634	 And it's orange and small and white stripes...	39
01:03:44,970	01:03:47,200	 Me. And the next one, just a guess, me.	39
01:03:47,239	01:03:49,764	 That's just scary. Wait, wait, wait.	39
01:03:49,808	01:03:51,639	 I have definitely seen this floating speck before.	39
01:03:51,676	01:03:53,200	 That means we've passed it before...	39
01:03:53,245	01:03:54,610	 and that means we're going in circles...	39
01:03:54,646	01:03:56,204	 and that means we're not going straight!	39
01:03:56,314	01:03:58,407	 Hey, hey! Get to the surface.	39
01:03:58,450	01:04:00,042	 We'll figure it out up there. Let's go!	39
01:04:00,085	01:04:02,280	 Hey! Relax. What?	39
01:04:02,320	01:04:04,914	 Take a deep breath.	39
01:04:06,858	01:04:07,359	 Now, let's ask somebody for directions.	39
01:04:09,194	01:04:11,219	 Fine. Who do you want to ask, the speck?	39
01:04:11,263	01:04:13,629	 There's nobody here! There has to be someone.	39
01:04:13,665	01:04:16,532	 It's the ocean, silly. We're not the only two in here.	39
01:04:16,568	01:04:18,900	 Let's see. OK, no one there.	39
01:04:18,937	01:04:23,397	 Nope. Nada.	39
01:04:24,809	01:04:26,606	 There's somebody. Hey! Excuse...	39
01:04:26,645	01:04:28,476	 Dory, Dory, Dory! Now it's my turn.	39
01:04:28,513	01:04:30,105	 I'm thinking of something dark and mysterious.	39
01:04:30,148	01:04:32,514	 It's a fish we dont know. If we ask it directions...	39
01:04:32,551	01:04:34,576	 it could ingest us and spit out our bones!	39
01:04:34,619	01:04:37,087	 What is it with men and asking for directions?	39
01:04:37,122	01:04:38,919	 I dont want to play the gender card right now.	39
01:04:38,957	01:04:40,891	" Let's play the ""Let's Not Die"" card."	39
01:04:40,926	01:04:42,826	 You want to get out of here? Of course I do.	39
01:04:42,861	01:04:46,126	 How are we gonna do that unless we give it a shot?	39
01:04:46,164	01:04:48,155	 Dory, you dont fully understand...	39
01:04:48,199	01:04:50,190	 Come on. Trust me on this.	39
01:04:58,276	01:05:02,113	 All right.	39
01:05:02,113	01:05:05,378	 Excuse me! Whoo-hoo! Little fella?	39
01:05:05,417	01:05:08,253	 Hello! Don't be rude. Say hi.	39
01:05:09,387	01:05:11,412	 Ha. Hello.	39
01:05:11,456	01:05:12,980	 His son Bingo... Nemo.	39
01:05:13,024	01:05:16,050	 Nemo was taken to... Sydney.	39
01:05:16,094	01:05:19,291	 Sydney! And it's really, really important...	40
01:05:19,331	01:05:21,265	 that we get there as fast as we can...	40
01:05:21,299	01:05:23,392	 so can you help us out?	40
01:05:23,435	01:05:26,962	 Come on, little fella. Come on.	40
01:05:27,005	01:05:30,236	 Dory, I'm a little fella.	40
01:05:30,275	01:05:33,778	 I dont think that's a little fella.	40
01:05:33,778	01:05:37,680	 Oh! Big fella. Whale. OK.	40
01:05:37,716	01:05:40,184	 Maybe he only speaks whale.	40
01:05:40,218	01:05:43,449	 Mooo! Weee neeed...	40
01:05:43,488	01:05:47,584	 Dory? Tooo fiind his son.	40
01:05:47,626	01:05:50,288	 What are you doing? Are you sure you speak whale?	40
01:05:50,328	01:05:51,596	 Can youuuu give us diiirectionsss?	40
01:05:53,765	01:05:56,097	 Dory! Heaven knows what you're saying!	40
01:05:56,134	01:05:59,729	 See, he's swimming away. Cooome baaack.	40
01:05:59,771	01:06:02,035	 He's not coming back. You offended him.	40
01:06:02,073	01:06:03,267	 Maybe a different dialect.	40
01:06:03,308	01:06:06,505	 Moooohhhmmooo... Dory!	40
01:06:06,544	01:06:09,809	 This is not whale. You're speaking upset stomach.	40
01:06:09,848	01:06:10,148	 Maybe I should try humpback. Don't.	40
01:06:12,083	01:06:13,550	 Wooooooo...	40
01:06:13,585	01:06:16,554	 You actually sound sick. Maybe louder?	40
01:06:16,588	01:06:18,055	 Rah! Rah! Don't do that!	40
01:06:18,089	01:06:19,818	 Too much orca. Didn't it sound orca-ish?	40
01:06:19,858	01:06:21,189	 It doesnt sound orca.	40
01:06:21,226	01:06:23,023	 It sounds like nothing I've ever heard.	40
01:06:23,061	01:06:25,552	 Oooooo! Ohh!	40
01:06:25,597	01:06:26,164	 It's just as well. He might be hungry.	40
01:06:27,565	01:06:30,557	 Whales dont eat clownfish. They eat krill.	40
01:06:30,602	01:06:34,129	 Swim away! Oh, look, krill!	40
01:06:35,540	01:06:38,510	 Move, Dory, move!	40
01:06:39,110	01:06:41,169	 Aah! Aah!	40
01:06:45,116	01:06:47,880	 Look at that. Would you look at that?	40
01:06:47,919	01:06:51,878	 Filthy. Absolutely filthy.	40
01:06:51,923	01:06:54,915	 All thanks to you, kid. You made it possible.	40
01:06:54,959	01:06:56,984	 Jacques, I said no cleaning.	41
01:06:57,095	01:06:58,858	 I am ashamed.	41
01:06:58,897	01:07:01,365	 Look! Scum angel!	41
01:07:03,601	01:07:05,535	 Ooh! Aaah!	41
01:07:05,570	01:07:07,504	 Bubbles! I love the bubbles!	41
01:07:09,574	01:07:13,203	 Flo? Has anybody seen Flo?	41
01:07:13,244	01:07:15,872	 9:00 and cue dentist.	41
01:07:15,914	01:07:18,178	 Hello, Barbara. Sorry I'm late.	41
01:07:18,216	01:07:20,912	 OK, here we go. Here we go, OK.	41
01:07:20,952	01:07:22,681	 Little Davey Reynolds...	41
01:07:22,721	01:07:24,313	 Walks to the counter, drops the keys...	41
01:07:24,355	01:07:26,448	 Bloat, that's disgusting!	41
01:07:26,491	01:07:28,516	 Tastes pretty good to me.	41
01:07:28,560	01:07:30,323	 Urrrp! Eww!	41
01:07:30,361	01:07:33,228	 Don't you people realize we are swimming in our own...	41

01:09:32,977	01:09:35,275	 We're in a whale, dont you get it?	42
01:09:35,313	01:09:36,473	 Whale? A whale!	42
01:09:36,514	01:09:39,244	 You had to ask for help! And now we're stuck here!	42
01:09:39,283	01:09:42,047	 Wow, a whale. I speak whale.	42
01:09:42,086	01:09:44,418	 No, you're insane! You cant speak whale!	42
01:09:44,455	01:09:47,652	 I have to get out! I have to find my son!	42
01:09:47,692	01:09:53,096	 I have to tell him how old sea turtles are!	42
01:09:55,466	01:09:58,299	 Ohhh!	42
01:09:59,704	01:10:02,332	 Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!	42

01:10:06,978	01:10:09,242	 you OK?	42
01:10:15,319	01:10:18,311	 There, there. It's all right.	43
01:10:18,356	01:10:20,290	 It'll be OK.	43
01:10:20,324	01:10:22,554	 No. No, it wont.	43
01:10:22,593	01:10:24,823	 Sure it will. You'll see.	43
01:10:24,862	01:10:30,994	 No. I promised him I'd never let anything happen to him.	43
01:10:31,035	01:10:34,436	 Huh. That's a funny thing to promise.	43
01:10:34,472	01:10:35,837	 What?	43
01:10:35,873	01:10:38,307	 You cant never let anything happen to him.	43
01:10:38,342	01:10:40,776	 Then nothing would ever happen to him.	43
01:10:43,814	01:10:46,578	 Not much fun for little Harpo.	43
01:10:55,426	01:10:57,257	 Hmm. What's going on?	43
01:10:57,295	01:10:59,593	 Don't know. I'll ask him.	43
01:11:02,133	01:11:08,163	 Dory... Whaaat's goooing onnn?	43
01:11:14,211	01:11:15,803	 I think he says we've stopped.	43
01:11:15,846	01:11:19,111	 Of course we've stopped. Stop trying to speak whale.	43
01:11:19,150	01:11:21,948	 You'll make things worse. What is that noise?	43
01:11:26,057	01:11:28,855	 Oh, no. Look what you did.	43
01:11:28,893	01:11:33,853	 The water's going down. It's going down!	43
01:11:37,568	01:11:39,001	 Really? You sure about that?	43
01:11:39,036	01:11:41,095	 Look! Already it's half empty!	43
01:11:41,138	01:11:42,901	 I'd say it's half full.	43
01:11:42,940	01:11:44,407	 Stop that! It's half empty!	43
01:11:47,478	01:11:50,675	 OK, that one was a little tougher.	44
01:11:50,715	01:11:53,284	 He either said we should go to the back of the throat...	44
01:11:53,651	01:11:55,812	 or he wants a root beer float.	44
01:11:55,853	01:11:57,480	 Of course he wants us to go there!	44
01:11:57,521	01:11:59,455	 That's eating us!	44
01:11:59,490	01:12:02,459	 How do I taste, Moby? Do I taste good?	44
01:12:02,493	01:12:04,757	 Tell him I'm not interested in being lunch!	44
01:12:04,795	01:12:07,263	 OK. Heee... Stop talking to him!	44
01:12:10,568	01:12:13,401	 Aah! Aah!	44
01:12:13,437	01:12:14,597	 What is going on?	44
01:12:14,639	01:12:16,937	 I'll check. Whaaat...	44
01:12:16,974	01:12:19,738	 No more whale! You cant speak whale!	44
01:12:19,777	01:12:22,109	 Yes, I can! No, you cant!	44
01:12:22,146	01:12:25,707	 You think you can do these things, but you cant, Nemo!	44
01:12:30,721	01:12:33,554	 OK. Dory! Oof!	44
01:12:36,127	01:12:39,722	 He says it's time to let go.	44
01:12:39,764	01:12:41,732	 Everything's gonna be all right.	44
01:12:41,766	01:12:43,427	 How do you know?	44
01:12:43,467	01:12:46,561	 How do you know something bad isn't gonna happen?	44
01:12:46,604	01:12:48,504	 I dont!	44
01:13:00,718	01:13:04,021	 Aah! Aah!	44
01:13:09,126	01:13:13,893	 Ha ha ha! We're alive!	44
01:13:14,965	01:13:17,832	 Look! Sy-d-ney... Sydney!	44
01:13:17,868	01:13:20,302	 Sydney! Sydney again!	44
01:13:22,306	01:13:24,774	 You were right, Dory! We made it!	44
01:13:24,809	01:13:27,744	 We're gonna find my son!	45
01:13:30,314	01:13:30,748	 Thaaank yoouuu, sirrr!	45
01:13:33,851	01:13:36,319	 Wow. I wish I could speak whale.	45
01:13:36,353	01:13:38,651	 All we gotta do is find the boat that took him.	45
01:13:38,689	01:13:41,783	 Right! We can do this!	45
01:13:55,406	01:13:57,704	 Morning.	45
01:13:57,742	01:14:01,007	 It's morning, everyone! Today's the day!	45
01:14:01,045	01:14:03,206	 The sun is shining, the tank is clean...	45
01:14:03,247	01:14:06,307	 and we are getting out... The tank is clean.	45
01:14:06,350	01:14:08,910	 The tank is clean!	45
01:14:08,953	01:14:10,545	 But how?	45
01:14:10,588	01:14:13,284	 Boss must've installed it while we were sleeping.	45
01:14:13,324	01:14:16,782	 What are we gonna do? What's it say, Peach?	45
01:14:18,162	01:14:19,493	 I cant hear you, Peach.	45
01:14:19,530	01:14:21,964	 The Aquascum 2003 is an all-purpose, self-cleaning...	45
01:14:21,999	01:14:23,967	 maintenance-free, salt water purifier...	45
01:14:24,001	01:14:26,993	 that is guaranteed to extend the life of your aquarium fish.	45
01:14:27,037	01:14:28,265	 Stop it!	45
01:14:28,305	01:14:29,795	 The Aquascum is programmed to scan...	45
01:14:29,840	01:14:32,138	 your tank environment every five minutes?!	45
01:14:32,176	01:14:33,871	 Scan? What does that mean?	45
01:14:35,513	01:14:37,344	 Aah!	45
01:14:38,749	01:14:39,150	 Temperature... 82 degrees...	45
01:14:40,351	01:14:42,012	 PH balance... normal.	45
01:14:42,052	01:14:44,452	 Ooh. Nice.	45
01:14:44,488	01:14:49,050	 Ooh... Oh! Curse you, Aquascum!	45
01:14:49,093	01:14:51,186	 That's it for the escape plan. It's ruined.	45
01:14:51,228	01:14:52,661	 Then what are we gonna do about...	45
01:14:52,696	01:14:53,164	 Darla!	45
01:14:54,732	01:14:57,326	 Stay down, kid!	45
01:14:57,368	01:14:59,336	 False alarm. Whew.	45
01:14:59,370	01:15:01,463	 My nerves cant take much more of this.	45
01:15:01,505	01:15:03,735	 What'll we do when that brat gets here?	46
01:15:03,774	01:15:06,004	 I'm thinking. Oh! Gill!	46
01:15:06,043	01:15:09,206	 Nemo! I'm coming! Help me! Help me!	46
01:15:09,246	01:15:13,148	 Swim down! Come on, kid!	46
01:15:13,184	01:15:14,674	 Everybody jump in! Swim down!	46
01:15:14,718	01:15:16,015	 That's it! What the...?	46
01:15:16,053	01:15:19,318	 Yay! Ha ha! Good work!	46
01:15:19,356	01:15:20,880	 Gill!	46
01:15:20,925	01:15:22,517	 Nemo! Sharkbait!	46
01:15:22,560	01:15:25,961	 Roll, kid! Lean! Lean!	46
01:15:30,434	01:15:32,868	 Whoops. That would've been a nasty fall.	46
01:15:32,903	01:15:35,497	 Gill! Don't let me go belly-up!	46
01:15:35,539	01:15:37,837	 Just calm down, Nemo. You wont go belly-up.	46
01:15:37,875	01:15:40,275	 I promise. You're gonna be OK.	46
01:15:43,247	01:15:45,272	 Darla!	46
01:15:48,752	01:15:52,483	 Do any of these boats look familiar to you?	46
01:15:52,523	01:15:54,423	 No, but the boat has to be here somewhere.	46
01:15:54,458	01:15:56,585	 Come on, Dory. We're gonna find it.	46
01:15:56,627	01:15:59,357	 I'm totally excited. Are you excited?	46
01:15:59,396	01:16:01,159	 Dory, wake up. Wake up, come on.	46
01:16:01,198	01:16:03,029	 Duck!	46
01:16:03,067	01:16:06,468	 That's not a duck. It's a... pelican!	46
01:16:06,503	01:16:07,936	 Whoa! Aah!	46

01:19:01,612	01:19:03,637	 What's happening? Why is he playing dead?	48
01:19:03,680	01:19:05,545	 He's gonna get flushed down the toilet.	48
01:19:05,582	01:19:07,982	 He's gonna get out of here! He's gonna get flushed!	48
01:19:08,018	01:19:09,781	 What a smart little guy!	48

01:20:13,584	01:20:15,984	 Why are you sleeping?	49
01:20:16,019	01:20:18,453	 Hurry! Bloat!	49

01:20:31,768	01:20:33,497	 Unh!	49
01:20:33,537	01:20:36,097	 Aaah! Get it out!	49

01:20:38,742	01:20:40,733	 Fish in my hair!	49
01:20:40,777	01:20:42,142	 Gill!	49
01:20:42,179	01:20:46,673	 Sharkbait... tell your dad I said hi.	49
01:20:46,717	01:20:48,207	 Unh! Eww!	49

01:20:53,023	01:20:55,389	 Ohh...	49

01:20:59,763	01:21:02,698	 I'm so happy! Is he gonna be OK, Gill?	49
01:21:02,733	01:21:04,963	 Don't worry. All drains lead to the ocean.	49
01:21:05,002	01:21:06,731	 Fishy!	49
01:21:08,338	01:21:11,603	 Aah!	49
01:21:11,642	01:21:14,236	 Aah! Whoa! Whoa!	49

01:21:56,420	01:21:57,888	 Truly, I am.	50
01:22:16,073	01:22:18,268	 Hey. Dory...	50
01:22:18,308	01:22:20,367	 if it wasn't for you...	50
01:22:20,410	01:22:23,208	 I never would've even made it here.	50
01:22:23,247	01:22:25,238	 So, thank you.	50
01:22:27,351	01:22:29,080	 Hey, wait a minute.	50
01:22:29,119	01:22:31,679	 Wait. Where are you going?	50
01:22:31,722	01:22:35,283	 It's over, Dory. We were too late.	50
01:22:35,325	01:22:40,092	 Nemo's gone, and I'm going home now.	50
01:22:40,130	01:22:42,621	 No. No, you cant.	50
01:22:44,468	01:22:46,231	 Stop!	50
01:22:47,838	01:22:49,601	 Please dont go away.	50
01:22:49,640	01:22:51,574	 Please?	50
01:22:51,608	01:22:54,372	 No one's ever stuck with me for so long before.	50
01:22:54,411	01:22:57,972	 And if you leave, I just...	50
01:22:58,015	01:22:59,949	 I remember things better with you.	50

01:23:08,792	01:23:10,885	 I know it is because when I look at you...	50
01:23:10,927	01:23:12,360	 I can feel it.	51
01:23:12,396	01:23:18,198	 I look at you and I... I'm home.	51

01:23:28,045	01:23:32,106	 I'm sorry, Dory, but I do.	51
01:23:43,393	01:23:46,658	 Manna from heaven. Sweet nectar of life!	51
01:23:46,697	01:23:48,756	 Hey! Hey! Hey!	51

01:23:57,240	01:23:58,867	 Just keep on swimmin'. You got that.	51
01:23:58,909	01:24:00,934	 Too right, mate!	51
01:24:00,977	01:24:02,274	 Oh! I got a live one here!	51
01:24:02,312	01:24:03,745	 Have you seen my dad?	51
01:24:03,780	01:24:06,010	 Gotcha! Hey! Hey! Come back here!	51
01:24:06,049	01:24:07,539	 You let him go!	51
01:24:07,584	01:24:09,720	 Hey! Hey!	51

01:24:26,837	01:24:29,237	 Ohh!	51
01:24:29,272	01:24:32,332	 Um, excuse me.	51
01:24:32,376	01:24:33,604	 Are you all right?	51
01:24:33,643	01:24:36,271	 I dont know where I am. I dont know what's going on.	51
01:24:36,313	01:24:39,180	 I think I lost somebody, but I cant remember.	51
01:24:39,216	01:24:43,312	 It's OK. I'm looking for someone, too.	51
01:24:43,353	01:24:45,787	 Hey, we can look together.	51
01:24:45,822	01:24:48,154	 I'm Dory.	51
01:24:48,191	01:24:49,351	 I'm Nemo.	52
01:24:49,393	01:24:52,760	 Nemo? That's a nice name.	52
01:25:01,705	01:25:04,640	 Dad! Dad!	52
01:25:04,674	01:25:06,733	 Wait a minute. Is it your dad or my dad?	52
01:25:06,777	01:25:09,245	 My dad. Got it. Dad!	52
01:25:09,279	01:25:11,543	 Where are we, anyway? Dad! Dad!	52

01:25:19,823	01:25:21,586	 Aah! Nemo!	52
01:25:21,625	01:25:23,991	 It's you! Aah! You're Nemo!	52
01:25:24,027	01:25:25,688	 Yes, yes, I'm Nemo!	52
01:25:25,729	01:25:28,323	 You're Nemo! You were dead. I saw you.	52
01:25:28,365	01:25:30,265	 And here you are! I found you.	52
01:25:30,300	01:25:33,030	 You're not dead. And your father... Your father!	52
01:25:33,069	01:25:35,435	 You know my father?! Where is he?	52
01:25:35,472	01:25:38,305	 This way! He went this way. Quick!	52

01:25:40,010	01:25:41,170	 Hey! Hey!	52
01:25:41,211	01:25:42,701	 Have you seen an orange fish swim by?	52
01:25:42,746	01:25:45,112	 It looks just like him! But bigger!	52
01:25:45,148	01:25:46,376	 Yeah, I saw him, bluey.	52
01:25:46,416	01:25:47,883	 But I'm not tellin' you where he went...	52
01:25:47,918	01:25:53,457	 and there's no way you're gonna make me.	52
01:25:53,457	01:25:54,617	 Mine.	52
01:25:54,724	01:25:57,488	 Aah! All right! I'll talk!	52
01:25:57,527	01:26:04,234	 He went to the fishing grounds! Aah!	52
01:26:04,234	01:26:06,099	 Hey, look out!	52
01:26:06,136	01:26:08,627	 I'm sorry. I'm just trying to get home.	52
01:26:09,673	01:26:13,404	 Dad! Dad!	52
01:26:13,443	01:26:14,842	 Nemo?	52
01:26:14,878	01:26:17,346	 Daddy! Nemo?	52
01:26:17,380	01:26:19,149	 Dad! Nemo's alive!	52

01:26:25,021	01:26:28,684	 Dad! Nemo! Thank goodness.	52
01:26:28,725	01:26:31,660	 It's all right, son. It's gonna be OK.	53
01:26:31,695	01:26:34,564	 Turn around! You're going the wrong way!	53
01:26:37,067	01:26:38,432	 Aah! Look out!	53

01:27:12,135	01:27:14,865	 We have to tell all the fish to swim down together!	53
01:27:14,905	01:27:17,601	 Get out of there now! I know this will work!	53
01:27:17,641	01:27:19,575	 No, I am not gonna lose you again!	53
01:27:19,609	01:27:23,045	 There's no time! It's the only way to save Dory!	53
01:27:24,347	01:27:25,814	 I can do this.	53
01:27:26,983	01:27:29,110	 You're right.	53

01:27:41,665	01:27:44,293	 Dory, you have to tell everybody to...	53
01:27:44,334	01:27:45,858	 Swim down together!	53
01:27:45,902	01:27:48,166	 Do you understand what I'm saying to you?	53

01:28:23,907	01:28:25,534	 That's it!	54
01:28:28,478	01:28:30,469	 It's working!	54
01:28:32,916	01:28:35,942	 Keep swimming! Keep swimming!	54
01:28:35,986	01:28:38,113	 Just keep swimming! Keep swimming!	54
01:28:38,154	01:28:39,621	 Come on, Dad!	54

01:29:09,552	01:29:13,147	 Dory! Where's Nemo? There!	54
01:29:14,858	01:29:17,918	 Oh, no. Nemo!	54
01:29:23,867	01:29:25,767	 Nemo?	54
01:29:29,773	01:29:33,766	 It's OK. Daddy's here. Daddy's got you.	54
01:29:38,214	01:29:39,374	 Daddy?	54
01:29:39,416	01:29:40,940	 Oh, thank goodness.	54
01:29:40,984	01:29:44,681	 Dad... I dont hate you.	54
01:29:44,721	01:29:46,552	 Oh, no, no, no.	55
01:29:46,589	01:29:49,251	 I'm so sorry, Nemo.	55
01:29:58,501	01:30:01,368	 Hey, guess what? What?	55
01:30:01,404	01:30:04,896	 Sea turtles... I met one.	55
01:30:04,941	01:30:09,139	 And he was 150 years old.	55
01:30:09,179	01:30:13,343	 150? Yep.	55
01:30:13,383	01:30:18,218	 Sandy Plankton said they only live to be 100.	55
01:30:18,254	01:30:19,812	 Sandy Plankton?	55
01:30:19,856	01:30:21,847	 Do you think I would cross the entire ocean...	55
01:30:21,891	01:30:23,984	 and not know as much as Sandy Plankton?	55
01:30:24,027	01:30:26,689	 Ha ha ha! He was 150! Not 100!	55
01:30:26,730	01:30:30,598	 Who is this Sandy Plankton who knows everything?	55
01:30:32,302	01:30:32,902	 Time for school! Get up! Let's go!	55
01:30:35,939	01:30:39,033	 I'm gonna win! No, you're not!	55
01:30:39,075	01:30:42,841	 I did it! Aw, my own son beats me!	55
01:30:42,879	01:30:45,347	 Climb aboard, explorers.	55
01:30:45,381	01:30:48,509	 The sea cucumber looks over to the mollusk and says...	55
01:30:48,551	01:30:51,418	" ""With fronds like these, who needs anemones?"""	55
01:30:53,123	01:30:55,353	 Hello, Nemo. Who's this?	55
01:30:55,458	01:30:58,916	 Exchange student. I'm from the E.A.C., dude!	55
01:30:58,962	01:31:01,590	 Sweet! Totally.	55
01:31:01,631	01:31:03,599	 Seriously, Marty.	55
01:31:03,633	01:31:05,601	 Did you really do all the things you say you did?	55
01:31:05,635	01:31:07,330	 Pardon me.	55
01:31:07,370	01:31:10,066	 Hello. Ohh.	55
01:31:10,106	01:31:11,767	 Don't be alarmed.	55
01:31:11,808	01:31:15,574	 We wanted to make sure our newest member got home safely.	55
01:31:15,612	01:31:17,944	 Thanks, guys. See you next week.	55
01:31:17,981	01:31:21,439	 Keep up with the program. Remember, fish are friends...	55
01:31:21,484	01:31:23,850	 Not food! Bye!	56
01:31:23,887	01:31:25,752	 Hold on, here we go!	56
01:31:25,789	01:31:27,484	 Next stop... knowledge!	56
01:31:27,524	01:31:29,992	 Bye, son! Have fun!	56
01:31:30,026	01:31:31,323	 Bye, Dad!	56
01:31:31,361	01:31:34,797	 Oh! Mr. Ray, wait. I forgot something.	56
01:31:39,469	01:31:42,097	 Love you, Dad.	56
01:31:42,138	01:31:44,129	 I love you, too, son.	56
01:31:46,409	01:31:49,810	 Dad? You can let go now.	56
01:31:49,846	01:31:53,577	 Sorry. Go have an adventure.	56

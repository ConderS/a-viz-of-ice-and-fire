<p begin="00:00:47.290" end="00:00:49.750">Rachel, let me see.</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.840" end="00:00:58.968">- Can I see?<br />- Finders keepers. And I found it.</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.135" end="00:01:00.678">In my garden.</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.388" end="00:01:04.223">Finders keepers.</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.189" end="00:01:12.690">Bruce?</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.695" end="00:01:19.405">Bruce?</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.741" end="00:01:24.202">Mom! Mr. Alfred!</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.141" end="00:01:49.310">Did you have dream?</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.769" end="00:01:51.646">Nightmare.</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.025" end="00:01:57.485">Worse than this place?</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.507" end="00:02:21.467">They are going to fight you.</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.843" end="00:02:23.469">- Again?<br />- Until they kill you.</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.680" end="00:02:27.473">Can they kill me before breakfast?</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.851" end="00:02:32.687">You are in hell, little man.</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.982" end="00:02:38.776">And I am the devil.</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.154" end="00:02:43.614">You're not the devil.</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.781" end="00:02:45.158">You're practice.</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.618" end="00:03:29.911">Solitary.</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.077" end="00:03:31.996">- Why?<br />- For protection.</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.705" end="00:03:35.041">- I don't need protection.<br />- Protection for them.</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.711" end="00:03:40.713">Get in.</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.592" end="00:03:46.928">Are you so<br />desperate to fight criminals...</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.094" end="00:03:49.597">...that you lock yourself in<br />to take them on one at a time?</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.806" end="00:03:54.727">Actually, there were seven of them.</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.894" end="00:03:57.188">I counted six, Mr. Wayne.</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.942" end="00:04:02.193">How do you know my name?</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.360" end="00:04:05.404">The world is too small for someone<br />like Bruce Wayne to disappear...</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.571" end="00:04:07.907">...no matter how deep<br />he chooses to sink.</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.074" end="00:04:09.242">Who are you?</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.408" end="00:04:12.578">My name is merely Ducard,<br />but I speak for Ra's al Ghul...</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.745" end="00:04:16.374">...a man greatly feared<br />by the criminal underworld.</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.541" end="00:04:18.125">A man who can offer you a path.</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.043" end="00:04:21.546">What makes you think I need a path?</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.921" end="00:04:24.549">Someone like you<br />is only here by choice.</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.715" end="00:04:27.093">You have been exploring<br />the criminal fraternity...</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.260" end="00:04:29.720">...but whatever<br />your original intentions...</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.429" end="00:04:33.766">...you have become truly lost.</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.309" end="00:04:39.105">And what path can Ra's al Ghul offer?</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.272" end="00:04:43.276">The path of a man<br />who shares his hatred of evil...</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.442" end="00:04:46.654">...and wishes to serve true justice.</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.113" end="00:04:49.240">The path of the League of Shadows.</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.326" end="00:04:54.620">- You're vigilantes.<br />- No, no, no.</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.787" end="00:04:58.958">A vigilante is just a man lost in<br />the scramble for his own gratification.</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.125" end="00:05:02.795">He can be destroyed or locked up.</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.130" end="00:05:08.968">But if you make yourself more<br />than just a man...</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.135" end="00:05:12.138">...if you devote yourself to an ideal...</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.305" end="00:05:14.807">...and if they can't stop you...</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.183" end="00:05:17.643">...then you become<br />something else entirely.</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.312" end="00:05:20.855">Which is?</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.355" end="00:05:24.317">Legend, Mr. Wayne.</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.651" end="00:05:27.278">Tomorrow, you will be released.</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.445" end="00:05:30.823">If you are bored of brawling with thieves<br />and want to achieve something...</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.990" end="00:05:34.494">...there is a rare blue flower<br />that grows on the eastern slopes.</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.660" end="00:05:36.329">Pick one of these flowers.</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.496" end="00:05:39.457">If you can carry it<br />to the top of the mountain...</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.624" end="00:05:42.543">...you may find what you were<br />looking for in the first place.</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.710" end="00:05:45.463">And what was I looking for?</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.173" end="00:05:49.133">Only you can know that.</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.825" end="00:06:59.912">You turn back. You go back.</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.480" end="00:08:09.524">Ra's al Ghul?</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.742" end="00:08:21.327">Wait.</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.121" end="00:08:25.832">What are you seeking?</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.541" end="00:08:28.543">I seek...</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.086" end="00:08:32.338">...the means to fight injustice.</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.713" end="00:08:34.841">To turn fear...</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.174" end="00:08:38.010">...against those<br />who prey on the fearful.</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.699" end="00:09:02.785">To manipulate the fears in others...</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.619" end="00:09:07.039">...you must first master your own.</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.582" end="00:09:09.375">Are you ready to begin?</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.293" end="00:09:12.879">I can... I can barely stand.</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.045" end="00:09:15.381">Death does not wait<br />for you to be ready!</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.548" end="00:09:18.718">Death is not considerate or fair!</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.218" end="00:09:23.848">And make no mistake,<br />here you face death.</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.727" end="00:09:29.061">Tiger.</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.688" end="00:09:32.481">Jujitsu.</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.692" end="00:09:35.735">Panther.</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.238" end="00:09:41.574">You're skilled. But this is not a dance.</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.038" end="00:09:48.581">And you are afraid.</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.542" end="00:09:53.419">But not of me.</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.881" end="00:09:59.383">Tell us, Mr. Wayne...</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.888" end="00:10:07.058">...what do you fear?</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.192" end="00:10:17.610">Bruce?</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.279" end="00:10:22.782">It's okay. It's okay.</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.949" end="00:10:24.450">You'll be okay.</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.700" end="00:10:27.119">Will we be needing<br />an ambulance, Master Wayne?</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.286" end="00:10:30.164">No, I'll set the bone<br />and take him for an x-ray later.</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.331" end="00:10:31.582">Very good, sir.</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.041" end="00:10:35.753">- I'm very sorry, sir. I've told...<br />- Don't worry. It's fine.</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.005" end="00:10:40.299">Took quite a fall,<br />didn't we, Master Bruce?</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.466" end="00:10:41.634">And why do we fall?</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.801" end="00:10:44.887">So we can learn to pick ourselves up.</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.641" end="00:10:51.519">Just a little fall.<br />It's just a small fracture.</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.486" end="00:11:02.321">The bats again?</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.491" end="00:11:07.618">You know why they attacked you,<br />don't you?</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.119" end="00:11:11.164">- They were afraid of you.<br />- Afraid of me?</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.330" end="00:11:13.332">All creatures feel fear.</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.499" end="00:11:14.834">Even the scary ones?</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.001" end="00:11:16.878">Especially the scary ones.</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.253" end="00:11:19.046">I got something to show you.</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.342" end="00:11:26.679">- You think your mother will like them?<br />- Yeah.</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.346" end="00:11:29.515">- I think it's time to get up.<br />- Maybe.</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.682" end="00:11:31.309">No going back to bed.</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.520" end="00:11:36.647">Did you build this train, Dad?</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.814" end="00:11:41.527">Gotham's been good to our family,<br />but the city's been suffering.</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.694" end="00:11:45.198">People less fortunate than us<br />have been enduring very hard times.</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.364" end="00:11:49.327">So we built a new, cheap, public<br />transportation system to unite the city.</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.494" end="00:11:51.204">And at the center...</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.370" end="00:11:53.206">...Wayne Tower.</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.372" end="00:11:56.250">- Is that where you work?<br />- No, I work at the hospital.</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.417" end="00:11:59.629">I leave the running of our company<br />to much better men.</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.795" end="00:12:01.672">- Better?<br />- Well...</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.839" end="00:12:04.091">...more interested men.</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.481" end="00:13:01.899">Can we go?</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.277" end="00:13:05.778">Please.</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.362" end="00:13:08.406">Okay. Let's go.</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.623" end="00:13:20.501">- What's wrong, Bruce?<br />- No, no. It was me.</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.668" end="00:13:22.795">I just needed some fresh air.</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.962" end="00:13:26.132">A little bit of opera goes a long way.<br />Right, Bruce?</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.759" end="00:13:31.470">Come on. Let's go.</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.934" end="00:13:38.686">Wallets, jewelry. Come on, fast.</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.853" end="00:13:40.313">- That's fine.<br />- Fast.</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.479" end="00:13:41.981">Take it easy.</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.648" end="00:13:44.192">Take it easy.</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.984" end="00:13:46.444">Here you go.</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.197" end="00:13:52.033">It's fine. It's fine.</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.909" end="00:13:56.037">Now just take it and go.</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.204" end="00:13:57.538">- I said, jewelry.<br />- Hey...</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.166" end="00:14:01.375">Thomas!</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.383" end="00:14:11.010">Bruce.</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.638" end="00:14:15.014">It's okay.</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.184" end="00:14:19.894">Don't be afraid.</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.717" end="00:14:53.511">Is this your father's?</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.054" end="00:14:57.181">It's okay.</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.391" end="00:15:00.017">Come here.</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.728" end="00:15:04.939">There you go.</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.067" end="00:15:10.069">It's okay.</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.821" end="00:15:13.739">It's okay.</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.743" end="00:15:19.245">Gordon.</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.336" end="00:15:28.921">Hey.</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.547" end="00:15:30.756">Good news.</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.216" end="00:15:34.093">We got him, son.</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.780" end="00:15:56.657">You're in excellent hands.</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.824" end="00:15:58.451">We'll be watching the empire.</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.618" end="00:16:01.621">When you grow up,<br />it'll be waiting for you.</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.637" end="00:16:20.765">I thought I might prepare a little supper.</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.937" end="00:16:28.022">- Very well.<br />- Alfred?</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.984" end="00:16:33.986">- Yes, Master Bruce?<br />- It was my fault, Alfred.</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.153" end="00:16:35.822">- I made them leave the theater.<br />- No.</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.988" end="00:16:39.033">- Lf I hadn't gotten scared...<br />- It was nothing that you did.</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.159" end="00:16:43.496">It was him, and him alone.</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.996" end="00:16:45.498">Do you understand?</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.626" end="00:16:51.671">I miss them, Alfred.<br />I miss them so much.</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.838" end="00:16:53.840">So do I, Master Bruce.</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.259" end="00:16:57.510">So do I.</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.637" end="00:17:02.640">And do you still feel<br />responsible for your parents' death?</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.807" end="00:17:04.892">My anger outweighs my guilt.</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.643" end="00:17:07.019">Come.</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.691" end="00:17:14.402">You have learned to bury<br />your guilt with anger.</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.569" end="00:17:17.613">I will teach you to confront it<br />and to face the truth.</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.116" end="00:17:25.079">You know how to fight six men.<br />We can teach you how to engage 600.</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.330" end="00:17:28.207">You know how to disappear.</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.374" end="00:17:30.585">We can teach you<br />to become truly invisible.</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.211" end="00:17:33.921">Invisible?</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.925" end="00:17:42.555">The ninja understands that invisibility<br />is a matter of patience and agility.</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.526" end="00:17:57.236">Always mind your surroundings.</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.406" end="00:18:02.617">Ninjitsu employs explosive powders.</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.118" end="00:18:06.370">- As weapons?<br />- Or distractions.</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.537" end="00:18:08.873">Theatricality and deception<br />are powerful agents.</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.332" end="00:18:12.376">You must become more than just a man<br />in the mind of your opponent.</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.837" end="00:18:16.797">- Who is he?<br />- He was a farmer.</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.964" end="00:18:20.218">Then he tried to take his neighbor's land<br />and became a murderer.</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.384" end="00:18:22.678">- Now he is a prisoner.<br />- What'll happen to him?</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.845" end="00:18:25.264">Justice. Crime cannot be tolerated.</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.431" end="00:18:29.393">Criminals thrive on the indulgence<br />of society's understanding.</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.439" end="00:18:36.275">Your parents' death was not your fault.</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.617" end="00:18:45.868">It was your father's.</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.764" end="00:19:09.600">Anger does not change the fact<br />that your father failed to act.</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.767" end="00:19:11.978">- The man had a gun.<br />- Would that stop you?</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.770" end="00:19:13.980">I've had training.</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.146" end="00:19:15.982">The training is nothing!</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.148" end="00:19:17.817">Will is everything!</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.614" end="00:19:25.449">The will to act.</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.209" end="00:19:36.460">Yield.</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.752" end="00:19:38.171">You haven't beaten me.</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.337" end="00:19:41.048">You have sacrificed sure footing<br />for a killing stroke.</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.681" end="00:19:50.474">Rub your chest.</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.975" end="00:19:53.853">Your arms will take care of themselves.</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.522" end="00:19:58.149">You are stronger than your father.</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.816" end="00:20:00.443">You didn't know my father.</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.610" end="00:20:02.904">But I know the rage that drives you.</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.070" end="00:20:05.364">That impossible anger<br />strangling the grief...</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.531" end="00:20:08.201">...until the memory<br />of your loved one is just...</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.367" end="00:20:10.369">...poison in your veins.</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.536" end="00:20:14.999">And one day, you catch yourself wishing<br />the person you loved had never existed...</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.417" end="00:20:18.878">...so you'd be spared your pain.</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.881" end="00:20:25.259">I wasn't always here in the mountains.</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.886" end="00:20:28.930">Once, I had a wife.</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.889" end="00:20:31.807">My great love.</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.975" end="00:20:35.102">She was taken from me.</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.269" end="00:20:38.481">Like you, I was forced to learn<br />there are those without decency...</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.648" end="00:20:41.943">...who must be fought<br />without hesitation, without pity.</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.736" end="00:20:46.072">Your anger gives you great power.</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.572" end="00:20:50.117">But if you let it, it will destroy you...</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.660" end="00:20:51.911">...as it almost did me.</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.578" end="00:20:55.540">- What stopped it?<br />- Vengeance.</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.748" end="00:20:57.583">That's no help to me.</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.750" end="00:20:59.585">Why, Bruce?</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.752" end="00:21:02.421">Why could you not<br />avenge your parents?</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.259" end="00:21:09.720">Will you be heading back to Princeton<br />after the hearing, sir...</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.887" end="00:21:12.557">...or can I persuade you to stay on<br />for a day or two?</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.723" end="00:21:14.934">I'm not heading back at all.</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.101" end="00:21:17.186">- You don't like it there?<br />- I like it fine.</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.562" end="00:21:20.356">They just don't feel the same way.</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.148" end="00:21:24.819">- I've prepared the master bedroom.<br />- No.</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.986" end="00:21:26.404">My room will be fine.</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.571" end="00:21:29.323">With all due respect, sir,<br />Wayne Manor is your house.</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.490" end="00:21:31.325">No, Alfred, it's my father's house.</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.492" end="00:21:33.661">- Your father is dead.<br />- This place is a mausoleum.</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.828" end="00:21:36.873">If I have my way, I'll pull<br />the damn thing down brick by brick.</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.039" end="00:21:41.127">This house, Master Wayne, has sheltered<br />six generations of your family.</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.294" end="00:21:44.005">Why do you give a damn, Alfred?<br />It's not your family.</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.839" end="00:21:48.718">I give a damn because a good man<br />once made me responsible...</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.385" end="00:21:51.554">...for what was most precious to him...</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.721" end="00:21:53.973">...in the whole world.</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.933" end="00:21:59.478">Miss Dawes has offered<br />to drive you to the hearing.</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.645" end="00:22:01.689">She probably hopes<br />to talk you out of going.</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.856" end="00:22:05.318">Should I just bury the past<br />out there with my parents, Alfred?</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.485" end="00:22:08.571">I wouldn't presume to tell you<br />what to do with your past, sir.</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.738" end="00:22:12.783">Just know that there are those of us who<br />care about what you do with your future.</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.160" end="00:22:15.661">Haven't given up on me yet?</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.329" end="00:22:17.830">Never.</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.379" end="00:23:10.383">Alfred still keeps the condensed milk<br />on the top shelf.</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.591" end="00:23:12.552">Hasn't he noticed<br />you're tall enough to reach now?</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.885" end="00:23:14.428">Old habits die hard, I guess.</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.595" end="00:23:17.014">- Never used to stop us anyway.<br />- No, it didn't.</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.181" end="00:23:19.058">How's your mom?</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.475" end="00:23:21.727">She misses this place.</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.229" end="00:23:24.730">So do I.</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.147" end="00:23:26.399">Yeah.</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.566" end="00:23:29.569">But it's nothing without the people<br />who made it what it was.</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.735" end="00:23:32.738">- Now there's only Alfred.<br />- And you.</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.905" end="00:23:36.450">- I'm not staying, Rachel.<br />- You're just back for the hearing.</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.079" end="00:23:44.250">Bruce, I don't suppose there's any way<br />to convince you not to come.</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.584" end="00:23:48.087">Someone at this proceeding...</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.754" end="00:23:50.923">...should stand for my parents.</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.090" end="00:23:53.217">We all loved your parents, Bruce.</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.384" end="00:23:56.596">- What Chill did is unforgivable.<br />- Then why is your boss letting him go?</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.972" end="00:24:01.225">In prison, he shared a cell<br />with Carmine Falcone.</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.392" end="00:24:05.062">He learned things, and he will testify<br />in exchange for early parole.</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.229" end="00:24:07.899">Rachel, this man killed my parents.</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.901" end="00:24:11.611">I cannot let that pass.</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.777" end="00:24:14.655">And I need you<br />to understand that, please.</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.407" end="00:24:17.617">Okay.</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.701" end="00:24:22.038">The depression hit working<br />people, like Mr. Chill, hardest of all.</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.205" end="00:24:25.416">His crime was appalling, yes,<br />but it was motivated not by greed...</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.750" end="00:24:27.418">...but by desperation.</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.585" end="00:24:31.506">Given the 14 years served, as well as<br />his extraordinary level of cooperation...</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.672" end="00:24:34.300">...with one of this office's<br />most important investigations...</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.467" end="00:24:37.595">...we strongly endorse his petition<br />for early release.</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.596" end="00:24:40.890">Mr. Chill?</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.477" end="00:24:46.145">Your Honor...</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.021" end="00:24:50.149">...not a day goes by that I don't wish<br />I could take back what I did.</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.777" end="00:24:56.030">Sure, I was desperate,<br />like a lot of people back then...</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.197" end="00:24:58.533">...but that don't change what I did.</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.161" end="00:25:06.833">I gather there is a member<br />of the Wayne family here today.</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.999" end="00:25:09.293">Has he got anything to say?</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.391" end="00:25:26.853">- He's coming out the side!<br />- He's coming out the side, guys!</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.529" end="00:25:37.822">Bruce Wayne!</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.658" end="00:25:41.868">Joe! Hey, Joe!</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.034" end="00:25:43.077">Falcone says hi.</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.880" end="00:25:55.464">Come on, Bruce.</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.840" end="00:25:57.466">We don't need to see this.</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.217" end="00:25:59.760">I do.</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.891" end="00:26:07.310">The DA couldn't understand<br />why Judge Faden insisted...</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.476" end="00:26:08.936">...on making the hearing public.</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.103" end="00:26:11.480">Falcone paid him off<br />to get Chill out in the open.</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.689" end="00:26:12.940">Maybe I should thank them.</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.107" end="00:26:15.693">- You don't mean that.<br />- What if I do, Rachel?</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.860" end="00:26:17.778">My parents deserved justice.</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.945" end="00:26:20.865">You're not talking about justice.<br />You're talking about revenge.</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.032" end="00:26:23.910">- Sometimes, they're the same.<br />- No, they're never the same.</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.076" end="00:26:27.663">Justice is about harmony. Revenge is<br />about you making yourself feel better.</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.830" end="00:26:31.125">- It's why we have an impartial system.<br />- Your system is broken.</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.216" end="00:26:41.052">You care about justice?<br />Look beyond your own pain, Bruce.</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.469" end="00:26:42.929">This city is rotting.</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.095" end="00:26:45.890">They talk about the depression<br />as if it's history. It's not.</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.057" end="00:26:47.558">Things are worse than ever here.</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.725" end="00:26:50.269">Falcone floods our streets<br />with crime and drugs...</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.436" end="00:26:53.397">...preying on the desperate,<br />creating new Joe Chills every day.</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.564" end="00:26:56.108">Falcone may not have killed<br />your parents, Bruce...</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.734" end="00:26:59.237">...but he's destroying everything<br />that they stood for.</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.783" end="00:27:06.661">You wanna thank him for that?<br />Here you go.</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.538" end="00:27:11.582">We all know where to find him.<br />As long as he keeps the bad people rich...</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.749" end="00:27:13.876">...and the good people scared,<br />no one'll touch him.</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.043" end="00:27:18.297">Good people like your parents, who'll<br />stand against injustice, they're gone.</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.464" end="00:27:22.176">What chance does Gotham have<br />when the good people do nothing?</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.052" end="00:27:26.472">- I'm not one of your good people, Rachel.<br />- What do you mean?</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.724" end="00:27:31.769">All these years, I wanted to kill him.</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.562" end="00:27:34.146">Now I can't.</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.037" end="00:27:51.747">Your father would be ashamed of you.</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.208" end="00:28:37.710">You're taller than you look<br />in the tabloids, Mr. Wayne.</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.169" end="00:28:40.046">No gun? I'm insulted.</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.216" end="00:28:47.011">- You could've just sent a thank-you note.<br />- I didn't come here to thank you.</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.178" end="00:28:49.931">I came to show you that<br />not everyone in Gotham's afraid of you.</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.097" end="00:28:51.724">Only those who know me, kid.</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.058" end="00:28:54.560">Look around you.<br />You'll see two councilmen...</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.894" end="00:28:57.730">...a union official,<br />couple off-duty cops...</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.147" end="00:28:59.774">...and a judge.</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.941" end="00:29:04.237">I wouldn't have a second's hesitation of<br />blowing your head off in front of them.</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.403" end="00:29:07.114">Now, that's power you can't buy.</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.740" end="00:29:09.200">That's the power of fear.</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.617" end="00:29:10.868">I'm not afraid of you.</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.035" end="00:29:12.954">Because you think you got<br />nothing to lose.</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.120" end="00:29:14.789">But you haven't thought it through.</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.956" end="00:29:18.042">You haven't thought about<br />your lady friend in the DA's office.</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.209" end="00:29:21.254">You haven't thought about<br />your old butler. Bang!</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.757" end="00:29:27.093">People from your world...</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.260" end="00:29:29.637">...have so much to lose.</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.804" end="00:29:34.141">Now, you think because your mommy<br />and your daddy got shot...</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.308" end="00:29:37.270">...you know about the ugly side of life,<br />but you don't.</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.436" end="00:29:39.564">You've never tasted desperate.</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.730" end="00:29:42.275">You're... You're Bruce Wayne,<br />the prince of Gotham.</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.441" end="00:29:45.862">You'd have to go 1000 miles to meet<br />someone who didn't know your name.</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.028" end="00:29:50.324">So don't come here with your anger,<br />trying to prove something to yourself.</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.491" end="00:29:52.618">This is a world you'll never understand.</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.785" end="00:29:54.787">And you always fear...</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.954" end="00:29:57.415">...what you don't understand.</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.293" end="00:30:01.669">All right.</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.302" end="00:30:12.138">Yeah, you got spirit, kid.<br />I'll give you that.</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.305" end="00:30:14.307">More than your old man anyway.</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.473" end="00:30:18.769">In the joint, Chill told me about<br />the night he killed your parents.</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.936" end="00:30:21.147">He said your father begged for mercy.</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.523" end="00:30:24.275">Begged.</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.442" end="00:30:25.818">Like a dog.</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.664" end="00:30:40.458">Should've tipped better.</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.468" end="00:30:52.303">- For what?<br />- Your jacket.</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.845" end="00:30:54.472">Okay.</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.556" end="00:30:59.018">Hey, hey, hey. Let me have it.<br />It's a nice coat.</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.185" end="00:31:01.312">Be careful who sees you with that.</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.896" end="00:31:03.815">- They're gonna come looking for me.<br />- Who?</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.273" end="00:31:05.983">Everyone.</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.277" end="00:31:10.029">It's...</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.196" end="00:31:12.198">It's a nice coat.</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.508" end="00:31:34.887">When you lived among<br />the criminals, did you start to pity them?</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.054" end="00:31:38.724">The first time I stole<br />so that I wouldn't starve, yes.</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.933" end="00:31:44.397">I lost many assumptions about<br />the simple nature of right and wrong.</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.690" end="00:31:47.775">And when I traveled...</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.942" end="00:31:50.653">...I learned the fear before a crime...</p>

<p begin="00:31:55.867" end="00:31:57.743">But I never became one of them.</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.580" end="00:32:03.708">Fool. What do I care<br />what your name is? You're a criminal.</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.875" end="00:32:05.543">I'm not a criminal</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.710" end="00:32:07.879">Tell that to the guy who owned these.</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.964" end="00:32:13.092">You've traveled the world<br />to understand the criminal mind...</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.259" end="00:32:14.552">...and conquer your fears.</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.637" end="00:32:20.766">But a criminal is not complicated.</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.933" end="00:32:24.270">And what you really fear<br />is inside yourself.</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.437" end="00:32:26.981">You fear your own power.</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.148" end="00:32:28.441">You fear your anger...</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.900" end="00:32:33.154">...the drive to do great<br />or terrible things.</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.321" end="00:32:36.782">Now you must journey inwards.</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.536" end="00:32:42.622">You are ready.</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.623" end="00:32:45.041">Breathe.</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.592" end="00:32:56.469">Breathe.</p>

<p begin="00:33:05.937" end="00:33:06.979">Face them.</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.481" end="00:33:11.275">To conquer fear,<br />you must become fear.</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.442" end="00:33:14.821">You must bask in the fear<br />of other men.</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.280" end="00:33:19.700">And men fear most<br />what they cannot see.</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.926" end="00:33:39.804">You have to become a terrible thought.</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.350" end="00:33:45.560">A wraith.</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.274" end="00:33:53.651">You have to become an idea!</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.533" end="00:34:03.578">Feel terror cloud your senses.</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.329" end="00:34:08.541">Feel its power to distort.</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.500" end="00:34:11.711">To control.</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.797" end="00:34:18.593">And know that this power<br />can be yours.</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.147" end="00:34:33.816">Embrace your worst fear.</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.823" end="00:34:43.117">Become one with the darkness.</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.929" end="00:35:04.639">Focus.</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.931" end="00:35:07.099">Concentrate.</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.266" end="00:35:09.393">Master your senses.</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.463" end="00:35:39.924">You cannot leave any sign.</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.299" end="00:35:41.509">I haven't.</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.809" end="00:35:51.811">Impressive.</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.903" end="00:36:02.989">We have purged your fear.</p>

<p begin="00:36:05.950" end="00:36:09.495">You are ready to become a member<br />of the League of Shadows.</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.123" end="00:36:16.294">But first, you must demonstrate<br />your commitment to justice.</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.019" end="00:36:34.395">No.</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.855" end="00:36:37.148">I'm no executioner.</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.690" end="00:36:41.360">Your compassion is<br />a weakness your enemies will not share.</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.736" end="00:36:44.030">That's why it's so important.</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.280" end="00:36:46.032">It separates us from them.</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.199" end="00:36:48.534">You want to fight criminals.<br />This man is a murderer.</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.701" end="00:36:50.620">- This man should be tried.<br />- By whom?</p>

<p begin="00:36:55.249" end="00:36:57.543">You know this better than most.</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.419" end="00:37:01.047">You cannot lead these men...</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.214" end="00:37:05.218">...unless you are prepared to do<br />what is necessary to defeat evil.</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.801" end="00:37:08.221">And where would I be leading<br />these men?</p>

<p begin="00:37:17.146" end="00:37:20.900">- How?<br />- Gotham's time has come.</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.067" end="00:37:24.403">Like Constantinople or Rome before it...</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.570" end="00:37:28.783">...the city has become a breeding ground<br />for suffering and injustice.</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.950" end="00:37:32.578">It is beyond saving<br />and must be allowed to die.</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.745" end="00:37:37.917">This is the most important function<br />of the League of Shadows.</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.209" end="00:37:41.295">It is one we've performed for centuries.</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.629" end="00:37:43.381">Gotham...</p>

<p begin="00:37:51.472" end="00:37:56.018">Ra's al Ghul rescued us from<br />the darkest corners of our own hearts.</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.185" end="00:38:00.606">What he asks in return is the courage<br />to do what is necessary.</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.815" end="00:38:04.152">I will go back to Gotham<br />and I will fight men like this...</p>

<p begin="00:41:02.955" end="00:41:06.083">I will tell him you saved his life.</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.811" end="00:41:27.355">Master Wayne,<br />you've been gone a long time.</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.522" end="00:41:29.816">- Yes, I have.<br />- You look very fashionable.</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.317" end="00:41:32.819">Apart from the mud.</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.069" end="00:41:35.738">Are you coming back to Gotham<br />for long, sir?</p>

<p begin="00:41:37.323" end="00:41:38.825">I want to show the people...</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.991" end="00:41:42.411">...their city doesn't belong<br />to the criminals and the corrupt.</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.578" end="00:41:45.790">In the depression, your father nearly<br />bankrupted Wayne Enterprises...</p>

<p begin="00:41:47.375" end="00:41:51.879">He believed his example could inspire<br />the wealthy of Gotham to save their city.</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.171" end="00:41:53.798">Did it?</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.924" end="00:41:56.384">In a way.</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.551" end="00:41:59.637">Their murder shocked the wealthy<br />and the powerful into action.</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.639" end="00:42:04.684">People need dramatic examples<br />to shake them out of apathy.</p>

<p begin="00:42:25.037" end="00:42:27.165">I assume that as you take on<br />the underworld...</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.331" end="00:42:32.461">...this symbol is a persona to protect<br />those you care about from reprisals?</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.628" end="00:42:34.005">You're thinking about Rachel?</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.172" end="00:42:36.549">Actually, sir, I was thinking of myself.</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.551" end="00:42:40.303">Have you told anyone I'm coming back?</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.511" end="00:42:44.724">I couldn't figure the legal ramifications<br />of bringing you back from the dead.</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.891" end="00:42:46.767">- Dead?<br />- You've been gone seven years.</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.934" end="00:42:48.227">You had me declared dead?</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.394" end="00:42:51.272">Actually, it was Mr. Earle.<br />He's taking the company public.</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.439" end="00:42:53.733">He wanted to liquidate<br />your majority shareholding.</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.900" end="00:42:56.235">Those shares are worth<br />quite a bit of money.</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.402" end="00:42:59.113">Well, it's a good thing<br />I left everything to you, then.</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.655" end="00:43:01.282">Quite so, sir.</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.449" end="00:43:05.203">And you can borrow the Rolls, if you like.<br />Just bring it back with a full tank.</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.254" end="00:43:19.967">In my opinion, Mr. Zsaz is as much<br />a danger to himself as to others...</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.343" end="00:43:24.931">...and prison is probably not the best<br />environment for his rehabilitation.</p>

<p begin="00:43:29.977" end="00:43:33.272">You think a man who butchers people<br />for the mob doesn't belong in jail?</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.439" end="00:43:36.108">I would hardly have testified to that<br />otherwise, would I?</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.275" end="00:43:39.362">This is the third of Falcone's thugs<br />you've had declared insane...</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.529" end="00:43:40.947">...and moved into your asylum.</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.155" end="00:43:45.785">The work offered by organized crime<br />must have an attraction to the insane.</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.328" end="00:43:49.330">Or the corrupt.</p>

<p begin="00:43:53.501" end="00:43:55.294">You should check<br />with Miss Dawes here...</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.461" end="00:43:59.841">...just what implications your office<br />has authorized her to make. If any.</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.803" end="00:44:06.138">- What are you doing?<br />- What are you doing, Carl?</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.305" end="00:44:07.682">Looking out for you.</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.184" end="00:44:13.104">Falcone has half the city<br />bought and paid for.</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.271" end="00:44:15.314">- Drop it.<br />- How can you say that?</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.481" end="00:44:19.193">Because as much as I care about<br />getting Falcone, I care more about you.</p>

<p begin="00:44:26.075" end="00:44:28.452">We've been through all that.</p>

<p begin="00:44:56.439" end="00:44:58.858">They nest somewhere in the grounds.</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.726" end="00:46:59.437">No more favors.<br />Someone is sniffing around.</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.604" end="00:47:02.565">Hey, I scratch your back,<br />you scratch mine, doc.</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.732" end="00:47:04.108">I'm bringing in the shipments.</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.817" end="00:47:06.027">We are paying you for that.</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.194" end="00:47:08.696">Maybe money isn't as interesting<br />to me as favors.</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.199" end="00:47:15.995">I am more than aware that you are<br />not intimidated by me, Mr. Falcone.</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.162" end="00:47:19.248">But you know who I'm working for,<br />and when he gets here...</p>

<p begin="00:47:23.127" end="00:47:25.588">And when he gets here,<br />he's not going to wanna hear...</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.755" end="00:47:30.843">...that you've endangered our operation<br />just to get your thugs out of jail time.</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.844" end="00:47:35.181">- Who's bothering you?<br />- There's a girl at the DA's office.</p>

<p begin="00:47:40.686" end="00:47:42.396">Well, there's an answer to that too.</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.772" end="00:47:45.733">- I don't want to know.<br />- Yes, you do.</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.904" end="00:47:53.366">No, we are showing<br />very healthy growth in these sectors.</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.533" end="00:47:56.702">I don't think Thomas Wayne would have<br />viewed heavy-arms manufacture...</p>

<p begin="00:48:00.414" end="00:48:04.210">Well, that's 20 years ago, Fredericks.</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.544" end="00:48:07.713">I think after 20 years<br />we can allow ourselves...</p>

<p begin="00:48:44.125" end="00:48:47.295">It's Wayne Enterprises, Mr. Earle.<br />I'm sure they'll call back.</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.628" end="00:48:50.131">Bruce? You're supposed to be dead.</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.298" end="00:48:52.258">I'm sorry to disappoint.</p>
